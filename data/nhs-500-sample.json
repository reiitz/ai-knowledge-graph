      "content": "What is social prescribing? Social prescribing is a key component of Universal Personalised Care . It is an approach that connects people to activities, groups, and services in their community to meet the practical, social and emotional needs that affect their health and wellbeing. In social prescribing, local agencies such as local charities, social care and health services refer people to a social prescribing link worker . Social prescribing link workers give people time, focusing on \u2018what matters to me?\u2019 to coproduce a simple personalised care and support plan , and support people to take control of their health and wellbeing. Social prescribing link workers also support existing community groups to be accessible and sustainable, and help people to start new groups, working collaboratively with all local partners. Social prescribing is an all-age, whole population approach that works particularly well for people who: have one or more long term conditions who need support with low level mental health issues who are lonely or isolated who have complex social needs which affect their wellbeing. You can find out more about social prescribing and the social prescribing link worker role in our frequently asked questions. Details about social prescribing link workers and how we are supporting with resources and through training and development can be found on our website . A standard model of social prescribing has been developed by NHS England in partnership with stakeholders, which shows the elements that need to be in place for effective social prescribing to happen. Social prescribing complements other approaches in a local area such as active signposting, where existing staff in local agencies provide information to signpost people to services, using local knowledge and resource directories. The NHS and social prescribing In the NHS Long Term Plan , NHS England committed to building the infrastructure for social prescribing in primary care and embed social prescribing and community-based approaches across the NHS. This includes introducing social prescribing link workers into primary care networks (PCNs) so that every person in England can access a social prescribing service through their GP practice, starting with 1,000 new social prescribing link workers in place by 2020/21, and a goal that at least 900,000 people will be referred to social prescribing by 2023/24. This is part of the drive to universal personalised care that will see at least 2.5 million people benefiting from personalised care by 2023/24. This is the biggest investment in social prescribing by any national health system and legitimises non-medical community-based activities and holistic support alongside medical treatment as part of a personalised care approach. In 2022/23, an additional requirement for primary care networks to provide a proactive social prescribing service was introduced as part of the contract. This means that primary care networks must work with a population experiencing health inequalities to proactively offer social prescribing interventions. To deliver the proactive social prescribing aspects of the requirements, primary care networks may wish to use population health management (PHM) data and intelligence from social prescribing services and the Health inequalities improvement dashboard in conjunction with lived experience to identify the patient cohort(s). Primary care networks can find more information about embedding social prescribing and social prescribing link workers in our PCN reference guide for social prescribing link workers . NHS England delivers a support offer for social prescribing link workers and wider workforce. You can find more details of our support offer , including our Workforce development framework , how to access our online networks and community of practice, and other helpful resources. Working with our partners The NHS England social prescribing team works closely with national partners including the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) and the National Academy for Social Prescribing (NASP) . NASP is an organisation dedicated to advancing social prescribing through championing social prescribing and the work of local communities in connecting people for wellbeing, and work to create partnerships cross-sector at a local and national level to achieve this. NHS England works closely with NASP, including supporting programmes such as the Thriving Communities programme , a national support programme for voluntary, community, faith and social enterprise groups, supporting communities to ensure the vital work of social prescribing succeeds on a local level. The Accelerating Innovation in Social Prescribing programme , a partnership with NASP and Royal Voluntary Service , came to an end in March 2023. However, NASP will continue some of the work of the programme, including Skillshare and the webinar programme, and continue to work on social prescribing innovation with members of the community of practice. The team also works closely with partners to deliver the cross-government Green social prescribing programme .

      "title": "NHS England \u00bb Perinatal mental health",
      "content": "Perinatal mental health (PMH) problems are those which occur during pregnancy or in the first year following the birth of a child. Perinatal mental illness affects up to 27% of new and expectant mums and covers a wide range of conditions. If left untreated, mental health issues can have significant and long-lasting effects on the woman, the child, and the wider family. Specialist PMH services provide care and treatment for women with complex mental health needs and support the developing relationship between parent and baby. They also offer women with mental health needs advice for planning a pregnancy. The NHS Long Term Plan builds on the commitments outlined in the Five Year Forward View for Mental Health to transform specialist PMH services across England. We aim to ensure that by 2023/24, at least 66,000 women with moderate/complex to severe PMH difficulties can access care and support in the community. As part of the \u00a32.3bn investment in mental health identified in the Long Term Plan, additional investment will support further service developments for perinatal mental health. Set out in detail in the Mental Health Implementation Plan , this includes: Increasing the availability of specialist PMH community care for women who need ongoing support from 12 months after birth to 24 months Improving access to evidence-based psychological therapies for women and their partners Mental health checks for partners of those accessing specialist PMH community services and signposting to support as required. We will also work to make it easier to access psychological support for those who experience mental health difficulties arising from, or related to, the maternity experience through the development of Maternity Outreach Clinics (this work will be delivered in partnership with the Maternity Transformation Programme ). Five years ago, access to specialist PMH services was variable and 40% of the country did not have a specialist community team. There are now specialist PMH community services in all 44 local NHS areas in England, and further developments planned. These enabled over 13,000 additional women to receive support from specialist PMH services in 2018/19 against our target of 9,000. Our national transformation programme also saw four new Mother and Baby Units open in areas of particular need in 2018/19 (in the North West, South West, South East Coast and East of England). This brought the total number of units in England to 19.",

      "content": "A personal wheelchair budget is a resource available to support people\u2019s choice of wheelchair, either within NHS commissioned services or outside NHS commissioned services. Personal wheelchair budgets enable postural and mobility needs to be included in wider care planning and can support people to access a wider choice of wheelchair. With a personal wheelchair budget, wheelchair users should expect to have: a personalised assessment where they are supported to identify the health and wellbeing outcomes they wish to achieve a care plan which captures the health and wellbeing outcomes identified, which may be part of any wider care plans the person requires for their care, for example an Education, Health and Care (EHC) plan care that is better integrated, meaning that different agencies work together to support their postural and mobility needs and achieve their health and wellbeing outcomes information provided upfront about the amount of money available in their personal wheelchair budget and the options available to them locally to use it information about the repair and maintenance of wheelchairs, if the option to purchase a wheelchair outside of the NHS commissioned service is taken. Since 2 December 2019, people who access wheelchair services, whose posture and mobility needs impact their wider health and social care needs, have a legal right to a personal wheelchair budget. The legal right covers people who are referred or already registered and meet the eligibility criteria of their local wheelchair service, when they require a new wheelchair either through a change in clinical needs or in the condition of the current chair. Further guidance is available for health and social care professionals on implementing the legal rights to personal health budgets , including personal wheelchair budgets.

Since publication we know everyone who cares about the NHS has been reflecting on how the three shifts set out in the plan can be taken forward, and what these reforms will mean for everyone who works in the NHS. Building on the 10 Year Health Plan we would like to continue this conversation and invite you to have your say on the 10 Year Workforce Plan. Get involved NHS partners and stakeholders are asked to contribute to a call for evidence open for six weeks until 7 November 2025, to support the development of the 10 Year Workforce Plan. Our aim is to create a plan that empowers staff, delivers world-class care, and secures the future of the NHS. We would like examples of best practice and innovation that can be scaled to meet the 10 Year Health Plan ambitions, as well as feedback on our research and modelling. This plan aims to create a sustainable workforce that is fit for the future, ensuring the NHS has the right people, in the right roles, with the right skills, so that every patient receives world-class care whenever they need it. It will support staff to work flexibly, grow their skills, and feel fulfilment in their careers. Your expertise and partnership will be central to making this vision a reality and we will continue to share opportunities for expert input as it develops.

      "content": "Clinical commissioning group authorisation: Draft guide for applicants has been published following its formal ratification at the Board meeting of the NHS Commissioning Board Authority (NHS CBA) on 13 April 2012. The guide is still formally a \u2018draft\u2019 because the authorisation regulations have yet to be passed by Parliament. As such, the final version is scheduled to be published in October 2012 once the NHS Commissioning Board is established. However, emerging CCGs should use this document as the basis for their authorisation applications. SHA clusters are working with their CCGs to agree which application wave each CCG will go into by 30 April 2012 and when all emerging CCG intentions are known the NHS CBA will assess the national picture to ensure that the overall \u2018authorisation pipeline\u2019 is deliverable. If there is any need to adjust numbers between waves, this will be done in discussion with SHA clusters. There is no advantage in being part of any particular wave as all CCGs will take on their new commissioning duties, if authorised, on 1 April 2013, regardless of when they were authorised. Work is also underway to develop and finalise the assessment process: the NHS CBA has been testing the 360-degree stakeholder survey, working with six emerging CCGs to test the questionnaire and develop an information pack; assessors are being appointed and an assessors\u2019 guide developed. An Authorisation Stakeholder Group has also been set up involving nine GP clinical leads from across the country who will feed in their views on the design of the process and its implementation as the work develops. Authorisation surgeries will be run in each region to support emerging CCGs in putting their applications together \u2013 more details on these will be available soon.

These candidates will be offered the opportunity to participate in a selection process starting in early May. Leaders of the 20-25 CSSs are being recruited to the same timetable as other NHS Commissioning Board senior roles, and are likely to be appointed from June 2012. The appointments will be made by a panel chaired by Dame Barbara Hakin, National Managing Director for Commissioning Development at the Board Authority, as the CSSs will be hosted by the Board Authority for up to three years. Checkpoint 2 panels get underway The panel meetings for the second stage of the commissioning support business review and assurance process \u2013 \u2018Checkpoint 2\u2019 \u2013 are underway. The series of 26 panels, which are taking place in Leeds and London, began on 23 April and will conclude on 4 May. The national moderation day, involving all panel chairs and other members of the NHS Commissioning Board Authority, will be on 8 May and the final decisions will be presented to the Board Authority\u2019s board meeting on 31 May. The panels cover the 25 NHS CSSs and the national communications and engagement CSS. Each panel will involve: A representative of the Board Authority who will chair the panel An emerging CCG leader An SHA director of commissioning development or a representative An independent business person. Panel members will receive a pack which includes the CSS prospectus, outline business plan, financial template, summary analysis from the Business Development Unit at the Board Authority, financial analysis from external accountants, and results of the emerging CCG and CSS surveys from NHS Clinical Commissioners. Members will also have a chance to hear the local \u2018soft\u2019 intelligence from the SHA in advance of the panel meeting. The tone of the day will be that of \u2018critical friend\u2019, and the approach will be developmentally focused. Each panel will need to agree a set of development areas to be included in the development plan following Checkpoint 2. The emerging CCG survey resulted in a 65 per cent response rate, with 141 emerging CCGs taking part. All 25 CSSs took part in the CSS survey. The results will be published as part of the papers for the Board Authority\u2019s board meeting in May. New \u2018simulation\u2019 case study being developed The first real-time commissioning support simulation exercise is being run on 17 May 2012 and will involve six emerging CCGs and four CSSs. The event, which is being organised by the NHS Commissioning Board Authority with the Health Services Management Centre at the University of Birmingham, and NHS Clinical Commissioners, aims to create a realistic environment in which participants, through role play, explore the ways that emerging CCGs will work with CSSs to commission effectively from their providers. The emerging CCGs and CSSs have been invited to reflect a range of sizes, locations and stages of development and include: CCGs in Bristol, Cheshire, Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, Enfield, Mid-Sussex and Horsham, and South of Tees CSSs in North West London, East Midlands, and Southampton, Hampshire, Isle of Wight and Portsmouth; plus a team of independent sector commissioning support service providers. The outputs of the day, which are expected to include lessons for both emerging CCGs and CSSs, will be made available on the Board Authority\u2019s website following the event. New \u2018informed customer\u2019 events \u2013 ask CCGs to sign up PCT and CSS colleagues are being asked to promote the importance of the \u2018informed customer\u2019 workshops with emerging CCG leaders. The workshops have been set up for 29 May in London and 7 June in Leeds , and the programme and booking are available online. Emerging CCGs need to be able to act as \u2018informed customers\u2019 who understand what they want, know how to procure it, and understand how to manage their support activities. The events will cover: An update on the latest developments in commissioning support Feedback from emerging CCGs including the recent national survey Feedback on the findings of the 17 May simulation event Key issues and considerations for emerging CCGs on procuring CSS resources Practical steps to help emerging CCGs plan their services. Podcasts of the case study presentations from the first event held in Birmingham in early March are available: Cheshire, Warrington and Wirral commissioning support Staffordshire commissioning support service The events are being run by NHS Clinical Commissioners and Primary Care Commissioning on behalf of the NHS Commissioning Board Authority. Additional tests for CSSs which provide national \u2018at scale\u2019 offers CSSs which plan to offer business intelligence, healthcare (clinical) procurement and business support components to their customers will be subject to additional tests in May and June 2012, following the Checkpoint 2 assurance process. These CSSs have already set out their working assumptions for these components within their outline business plans. The tests will focus on: The CSSs ability to deliver against defined standards (currently under development by the CSSs and the NHS Commissioning Board Authority) Making sure the cost structure is appropriate and sustainable Making sure there is the capability to deliver good quality and the right expertise across an appropriate scale to customers. The high level criteria have been circulated and the detailed assessment criteria will be published soon. By 31 May each CSS will be asked to submit detailed proposals for the scale services it wishes to provide. By the end of June, the Business Development Unit at the Board Authority will have reviewed the CSS submissions and identified the final configuration and development plans. The three national \u2018at scale\u2019 offers cover: Business intelligence Integration centres that provide data validation, integration and storage. The role of these centres is to cleanse, validate and link national and local data sets according to local rules and requirements, to provide meaningful conformed data for further analysis. Healthcare (clinical) procurement Market management activities such as market engagement, market analysis and market development. Procurement strategy/activities such as procurement project management, strategy development and technical advice/compliance. Aligned activities such as service specification development, negotiation support and contract management. Business support services HR, payroll, procurement of goods and services, and informatics. Integrated finance and accounting system The NHS Commissioning Board Authority has signed a contract between the NHS Commissioning Board (NHS CB) and NHS Shared Business Services (SBS) to provide an integrated finance and accounting system to the NHS CB from October 2012 and CCGs from April 2013. The use of the common system has been agreed to ensure proper financial and corporate governance, financial consistency, proper risk management relating to the transfer of financial information and the adoption of best practice in business processes. The integrated system will create a basic common infrastructure which will also be cost-effective and save time for organisations in terms of development. The SBS solution is already the most widely used finance and accounting system in the NHS by both commissioners and providers. The NHS CB will meet the contract costs in full and does not intend to recharge CCGs. It will be one of the requirements of the authorisation process that CCGs use the integrated system. The decision has been approved by the Cabinet Office as being good value for money and in keeping with the strategy for \u2018back office\u2019 functions. New ready reckoner with service lines in development An upgraded version of the ready reckoner \u2013 which models how emerging CCGs plan to spend their running costs \u2013 will be released in May. It will include around 30 service lines which are being developed to describe CSSs in a consistent way. News in brief Clinical commissioning group authorisation: Draft guide for applicants has been published following its formal ratification at the Board meeting of the NHS Commissioning Board Authority on 13 April 2012. The guide is still formally a \u2018draft\u2019 because the authorisation regulations have yet to be passed by Parliament. As such, the final version is scheduled to be published in October 2012 once the NHS Commissioning Board is established. However, emerging CCGs should use this document as the basis for their authorisation applications. The NHS Commissioning Board Authority and Department of Health are planning to ask PCTs for details of their 2011-12 spend, focused principally on future CCG and NHS Commissioning Board responsibilities. This will provide a view of current spending arrangements and help the Board Authority to plan CCG and NHS Commissioning Board responsibilities for 2013-14. PCTs will be asked to involve emerging CCG finance leads in discussions about these returns. Comments on this page are now closed. Share: Tweet",

This edition covers a wide range of areas and includes a link to the final Clinical commissioning group authorisation: Draft guide for applicants document, a link to the new CCG HR Guide and an update on the leadership assessment process for CCG leaders. The authorisation guide is a key document and I\u2019m pleased to say that the NHS Commissioning Board Authority approved it at its meeting on 13 April 2012. The document is also discussed in a letter to emerging CCG leaders from Board Authority Chief Executive Sir David Nicholson which is attached to this issue of the bulletin. The Board Authority is absolutely clear that our aim is to support emerging CCGs to be the best they can be. The guide \u2013 which many of you contributed to \u2013 sets out the route for the year ahead. We\u2019ve also published today a CCG HR Guide which is an important document both for emerging CCGs and the many NHS staff who are hoping to transfer to jobs in these new organisations. There are complexities associated with the HR transition process and each emerging CCG should be receiving the support they need from their local HR lead. There will be further HR updates \u2013 particularly with regard to remuneration \u2013 in the next few months. A key step for emerging CCGs will be the recruitment into the key senior leadership roles. I am pleased to let you know that we have provided additional places at the leadership assessment centre for future CCG leaders, to align with the CCG authorisation timetable. There is more detail in the piece below. Lastly, we have also included the key messages from Sir David Nicholson\u2019s \u2018Next Steps for Transition\u2019 that specifically relate to clinical commissioning and I urge you to read the full document which was published at the end of March 2012. I included a link in my last bulletin but have since become aware that it has not been as widely read as I\u2019d anticipated so we\u2019ve also summarised the key messages relating to commissioning in this bulletin. While the principal audience for this bulletin is leaders of emerging CCGs, we are happy to share it with anyone from an NHS or stakeholder organisation with an interest in commissioning development. Therefore, if you would like to be added to the mailing list to receive it directly, please send your contact details to pathfinderlearningnetwork@nhs.net . If you have any questions, comments or feedback about the commissioning development programme you can also email pathfinderlearningnetwork@nhs.net . Dame Barbara Hakin National Director for Commissioning Development Letter to emerging CCG leaders from Sir David Nicholson NHS Commissioning Board Authority Chief Executive Sir David Nicholson has written to emerging CCG leaders to highlight the publication of the final draft version of Clinical commissioning group authorisation: Draft guide for applicants . Read the letter to emerging CCG leaders from David Nicholson Authorisation: Final draft guide published and next steps outlined Clinical commissioning group authorisation: Draft guide for applicants has been published this month following its formal ratification at the Board meeting of the NHS Commissioning Board Authority on 13 April 2012. There have been some very minor amends since the Board papers were published on 5 April 2012, so please use this updated version. The guide is still formally a \u2018draft\u2019 because the authorisation regulations have yet to be passed by Parliament. As such, the final version is scheduled to be published in October 2012 once the NHS Commissioning Board is established. However, emerging CCGs should use this document as the basis for their authorisation applications. A factsheet and a set of frequently asked questions (FAQs) are also available. SHA clusters asked emerging CCGs to self-nominate into an applicant wave by the end of April and have provided a report on each emerging CCG\u2019s readiness and their recommendation of a wave to the same timescale. The SHA reports will be discussed with the emerging CCG before submission and it is anticipated that in most cases the SHA and emerging CCG view of the appropriate wave will be the same. Where this is not the case the Board Authority will have further discussions with both parties. When all emerging CCG intentions are known the Board Authority will assess the national picture to ensure that the overall \u2018authorisation pipeline\u2019 is deliverable. This may lead to the need to adjust numbers between waves. This will be done in discussion with SHA clusters to identify which emerging CCGs might change waves. There is no advantage in being part of any particular wave as all CCGs take on their new commissioning duties, if authorised, on 1 April 2013, regardless of the wave in which they were authorised. Work is also underway to develop and finalise the assessment process: the Board Authority has been testing the 360-degree stakeholder survey, working with six emerging CCGs to test the questionnaire and develop the information pack, and assessors are being appointed and an assessors\u2019 guide developed. It has also set up an Authorisation Stakeholder Group involving nine GP clinical leads who will feed in their views on the design of the process and its implementation as the work develops. These clinical leads are: London Dr Howard Freeman \u2013 Merton Dr Amr Zeineldine \u2013 Southwark North Dr Richard Cullen \u2013 Rotherham Dr Stephen Kirk \u2013 Gateshead Dr Chris Clayton \u2013 Blackburn with Darwen South Dr Rod Smith \u2013 North and West Reading Dr Mark Jones \u2013 Canterbury East Midlands Dr Dave Briggs \u2013 East Leicestershire and Rutland Dr Hugh Porter \u2013 Nottingham City Authorisation surgeries will be run in each region to support emerging CCGs in putting their applications together \u2013 and more details on these will be available soon. New places available at leadership assessment centre Hundreds of people interested in leadership roles in emerging CCGs are currently signing up for additional places at the leadership assessment centres for future CCG leaders. Demand has been high so the NHS Leadership Academy has procured additional places for May, June and July 2012 Prospective CCG leaders in a CCG which is in the first wave for authorisation, which will be announced in May, will be guaranteed a place that fits with their authorisation timetable. Equally, the aim is to ensure that those who are shortlisted for one of the CCG leadership posts, but have not been through an assessment centre, have the chance to do so. Some slots are being held in reserve to ensure this demand can be met. In addition, the online assessment process has been improved to allow people to register and use the online assessment elements without requiring them to immediately book a place at the formal assessment centre. The assessment centre, which is being run by Hay Group, and overseen by the NHS Leadership Academy, on behalf of the Board Authority, opened on 27 April 2012 and runs through to September 2012. Access to the assessment centre has been prioritised for those with a serious interest in becoming a CCG leader, who are either a clinician, or a \u2018Very Senior Manager\u2019 grade, or equivalent, manager. Those who have a serious interest in becoming a Chief Finance Officer in a CCG are being invited into a different process, run by Penna, unless they are also applying to be an Accountable Officer, in which case they will be assessed by Hay Group. If anyone has any queries or needs assistance please contact the Hay Group helpline at NHSCCGassessment@haygroup.com or 0161 831 2478. HR Guidance for CCGs An HR guide and a set of frequently-asked-questions (FAQs) have been produced to help HR leads in PCTs support emerging CCGs as they design their leadership arrangements and supporting structures, and move to recruiting to key roles. It has been published to support those CCGs who wish to be able to recruit to the same timescales as the NHS Commissioning Board Authority, and gain access to the widest talent pool. The framework will enable CCGs to secure the best possible clinical commissioning arrangements, by helping them to: enable clinicians to take on senior leadership roles abide by the principles of the HR Transition Framework, including fair treatment of staff and minimising redundancies establish suitable partnership arrangements. The CCG HR Guide and FAQs provide practical advice about how emerging CCGs can approach the main HR issues that they are likely to encounter as they become established, including the senior appointments process, transfers of NHS staff and the use of NHS pay arrangements. For more information about the HR Guide please email ccgdevelopment@nhs.net . CCGs and Agenda for Change Media coverage about CCGs\u2019 arrangements for paying staff has given rise to the need to clarify key points about Agenda for Change. CCGs will not be obliged to use NHS pay arrangements, such as those set out under Agenda for Change or the Very Senior Managers\u2019 Pay Framework. The Health and Social Care Act 2012 is clear in saying that CCGs will be free to pay their staff what they choose, in accordance with the determinations of the CCG\u2019s governing body. In addition, CCGs may also choose to use any guidance issued by the NHS Commissioning Board. However, employees who transfer to CCGs under the TUPE Regulations 2006 will have the legal right to transfer on their existing pay and terms and conditions at the time of transfer. Employees who transfer to CCGs under circumstances where TUPE 2006 does not apply may also receive employment protection under the terms of a statutory Transfer Scheme. This is based on general employment law and is not specific to the health service. The CCG HR Guide outlines the processes for appointing and transferring employees and what it means for CCGs. It says that throughout the process, current and future employers will be responsible for ensuring that all decisions comply with employment and equality legislation and guidance on public sector transfers. PCTs and CCGs have a duty as public sector bodies to ensure that decisions are fair, transparent and accountable. For further information please contact your PCT HR lead. Financial planning exercise The NHS Commissioning Board Authority and Department of Health are planning to ask PCTs for details of their 2011-12 spend, focused principally on future CCG and NHS Commissioning Board responsibilities. This will provide a view of current spending arrangements and help the Board Authority to plan CCG and NHS Commissioning Board responsibilities for 2013-14. PCTs will be asked to involve emerging CCG finance leads in discussions about these returns. Commissioning support: New \u2018informed customer\u2019 events Emerging CCG leaders are being encouraged to sign up for the \u2018informed customer\u2019 workshops which will help them determine what they need from commissioning support services. The workshops have been set up for 29 May in London and 7 June in Leeds , and the programme and booking are available online. CCG leaders need to be able to act as \u2018informed customers\u2019 who understand what they want, know how to procure it, and understand how to manage their support activities. The events will cover: Key issues and considerations for emerging CCGs on procuring CSS resources An update on the latest developments in commissioning support Feedback from emerging CCGs including the recent national survey Feedback on the findings of the 17 May simulation event Practical steps to help emerging CCGs plan their services. Podcasts of the case study CSS presentations from the first event held in Birmingham in March are available here: Cheshire Warrington and Wirral commissioning support Staffordshire commissioning support service The events are being run by the NHS Clinical Commissioners (NHS Alliance and NAPC) and Primary Care Commissioning on behalf of the NHS Commissioning Board Authority. Commissioning support: Checkpoint 2 panels underway The panel meetings for the second stage of the commissioning support business review and assurance process \u2013 \u2018Checkpoint 2\u2019 \u2013 are underway. The series of 26 panels began on 23 April and will conclude on 4 May. The national moderation day, involving all panel chairs and other members of the NHS Commissioning Board Authority, will be on 8 May and the final decisions will be presented to the Board Authority\u2019s board meeting for discussion on 31 May. The 26 panels cover the 25 local NHS commissioning support services (CSS) and the nationwide communications and engagement CSS. Each panel will involve: A representative of the Board Authority who will chair the panel An emerging CCG leader An SHA director of commissioning development or a representative An independent business person. CSSs which aim to offer business intelligence, healthcare (clinical) procurement and business support components to customers will be subject to additional tests in May and June 2012, following the Checkpoint 2 assurance process. Commissioning support: New \u2018simulation\u2019 case study being developed The first real-time commissioning support simulation exercise is being run on 17 May involving six emerging CCGs and four CSSs. The event, which is being organised by the NHS Commissioning Board Authority with the Health Services Management Centre at the University of Birmingham and NHS Clinical Commissioners, aims to create a realistic environment in which participants, through role play, explore the ways that CCGs will work with CSSs to commission effectively from their providers. The emerging CCGs and CSSs have been invited to reflect a range of sizes, locations and stages of development and include: CCGs in Bristol, Cheshire, Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, Enfield, Mid-Sussex and Horsham, and South of Tees CSSs in North West London, East Midlands, and Southampton, Hampshire, Isle of Wight and Portsmouth; plus a team of independent sector commissioning support service providers. The outputs of the day, which are expected to include lessons for both emerging CCGs and CSSs, will be made available on the Board Authority\u2019s website following the event. CSS managing director recruitment The NHS Commissioning Board Authority has written to SHAs to ask them to nominate those people in \u2018Very Senior Manager\u2019 positions who wish to apply to be commissioning support service (CSS) managing directors. These candidates will be offered the opportunity to participate in a selection process starting in early May. Leaders of the 20-25 CSSs are being recruited to the same timetable as leaders for the local area teams of the NHS Commissioning Board, and are likely to be appointed from June 2012. The appointments will be made by a panel chaired by Dame Barbara Hakin, National Managing Director for Commissioning Development at the Board Authority, as the CSSs will be hosted by the Board Authority for up to three years. Sir David Nicholson\u2019s \u2018Next Steps for Transition\u2019 message NHS Chief Executive Sir David Nicholson has written to NHS staff about transition arrangements following the publication of the Health and Social Care Act. Here\u2019s a summary of the chapter relating to clinical commissioning, which was published on 29 March: Clinical commissioning groups The vast majority of aspiring CCGs have confirmed their member practices and established an effective geographic area. We are continuing work with a very small handful of prospective CCGs not yet configured effectively for future success. The latest information from this process indicates a likely total of up to 220 CCGs across the country. These emerging CCGs are already operating under delegated authority, increasingly taking on day-to-day commissioning responsibilities on behalf of PCT clusters. Currently 59 per cent of their future commissioning budgets have already been delegated to them and we expect that figure to increase further during 2012-13. It will be particularly important for CCGs to secure the right leadership. This is why we are offering national development and assessment support for potential governing body chairs, chief finance officers and accountable officers. This process started in mid-March 2012 and will run throughout the year, but ensuring early feedback by July so emerging CCGs can make designate senior appointments in line with the common timetable. The first wave of applications for authorisation will be made in July, with decisions by the Board from October. Subsequent waves will follow with the aim of completing the initial round of assessments by January 2013. This will allow time for arrangements to be made where authorisation is subject to conditions. Engaging aspiring and authorised CCGs in the broader development of the commissioning system will also be critical to our success. To this end, the Board Authority is currently working with a design group of emerging CCG leaders to propose effective ways of engaging each and every CCG, including a proposed \u2018assembly\u2019 \u2013 a vehicle to enable effective joint-working on big shared issues, such as setting allocation rules and commissioning for quality. This approach will be tested further through informal arrangements from April 2012, with the aim of having an agreed system in place for the autumn. Commissioning support CSSs are now developing across the country, working with emerging CCGs to develop high value offers, in areas such as contract management, service redesign, analytical support and other professional services. A range of models is emerging, with CSSs providing a variety of bespoke offers and national offers in a small number of areas. The first checkpoint for the development of local CSSs being developed by PCT clusters took place at the start of 2012. A total of 36 prospective services were assessed. The number of services reduced to 25 by the time of Checkpoint 2 started at the end of March 2012 and which will finish in mid-May. The final checkpoint where CSSs submit a full business plan will be completed by the end of August and the Board will take decisions on the hosting of CSSs in October 2012. There will be a national assessment process and development support will be provided for prospective leaders of CSSs as part of this process. The Board Authority will aim to appoint these leaders from June 2012, in line with the broader national timetable. CSSs will then be able to develop their capacity in line with the national timeline. The NHS Commissioning Board The Board Authority has now been in place for several months and is leading on the development of the new commissioning system. Most of the very senior appointments have been made and three public board meetings have taken place where key principles for the design of the Board and the broader commissioning system were agreed. The Board will become an Executive Non-Departmental Public Body in October when it will take on responsibility for the authorisation of CCGs and other responsibilities for preparing the new system. It takes on its full statutory responsibilities in April 2013. The Board will be organised into nine national directorates, four slim, sub-national regions and a national network of local offices, led by local area teams, in which the bulk of its staff will be based to fulfil their NHS-facing functions. These will include the oversight of CCGs, membership of local health and wellbeing boards and the direct commissioning of: primary care services, specialised NHS services, military health services, offender health services and a range of public health services. They will also have important responsibilities in relation to NHS emergency planning and response and the quality assurance of NHS services, as well as delivering responsible officer functions. The geographical footprint for the regions will mirror those of the four current SHA clusters, with those of the local area teams being developed from PCT cluster areas. A People Transition Policy for the Board has been published and recruitment will take place in line with the broader national timetable. We are also working to develop clinical networks and senates across the country to provide support for CCGs in developing services for particular patient groups and across particular areas. We anticipate the Board will host networks and senates across 12-15 core areas, though networks will operate across a range of different geographical footprints. We will look to align these arrangements wherever possible with the development of academic health science networks and local education and training boards. Integrated finance and accounting system The NHS Commissioning Board Authority\u2019s board meeting on 13 April 2012 noted the decision to adopt the integrated finance and accounting system from NHS Shared Business Services for the new commissioning architecture and to make it an authorisation requirement for CCGs. The decision has been approved by the Cabinet Office as being good value for money and in keeping with the strategy for \u2018back office\u2019 functions. If you have any questions about this please contact your SHA Cluster Director of Commissioning Development. Updated governance resources The draft governance documents and frequently-asked-questions have been updated following the publication of the Health and Social Care Act. They need to be read in conjunction with Towards establishment: Creating responsible and accountable CCGs which was published in February 2012. The resources, which are optional, have been designed to be flexible and to be tailored for local use. They have been developed in response to requests from emerging CCG leads and include: Model Constitution Framework including Standing Orders, Prime Financial Policies, and Scheme of Delegation Templates Governing Body Committees: Terms of Reference Templates Clinical commissioning group governing body members: Role outlines, attributes and skills(includinga role outline for an optional Chief Operating Officer) Frequently-asked-questions. All the materials can be seen and downloaded from the Resources for CCGs page . There is also a web-based toolkit \u2013 Best Practice Resource/Practical Toolkit for the appointment of lay members to Clinical Commissioning Groups \u2013 based on best practice developed by the Appointments Commission which covers all the steps emerging CCGs may wish to consider in the appointment of lay members to governing bodies. Whilst there are material differences between lay members and non-GP clinical members in terms of roles, the underpinning principles and good practice contained in the toolkit are in the main generic and therefore could also be used as a basis for the non-GP clinical member appointments process. Webinar with Barbara Hakin A reminder that Barbara Hakin is planning another session in her series of online webinar teleconferences for clinical leaders. Webinar technology combines the desktop sharing of slides through the web with teleconferencing, so everyone who is logged on sees and hears the same presentation and is able to contribute. This enables Barbara to discuss current issues with CCG leaders quickly and directly, without the need for participants to travel. The dates of the next sessions on CCG authorisation (both sessions are the same content) are: Wednesday 2 May, 12.15-13.00 Thursday 3 May, 18.30-19.15 Invitations and registration details have already been sent to clinical leaders. If you have not received your invite, or if you would like to register for one of the sessions please email chris.ricot@dh.gsi.gov.uk . Pathfinder Learning Network Remember that you can still find the latest news and information for emerging CCGs on the Pathfinder Learning Network. Recent updates include: A new in-depth CCG case study from Liverpool A new CCG case study from Wandsworth about patient and public involvement A discussion about emerging Health and Wellbeing Boards a year ahead of their establishment A new guide for commissioners on how NHS staff and service users can work together to improve services.

      "content": "It was great to see so many student nurses, nurse lecturers and education providers at the first Student Nursing Times Awards in London. How we educate and train tomorrow\u2019s nurses is fundamental to the success of the NHS in the future, so I was really happy to be asked to say a few words after lunch. As the awards were presented it was clear we have some fantastic teaching institutions, educating the next generation of nurses. At the same time, there are some fabulous lecturers and we are arranging placements that consistently match the student nurse to the right training and the most inspiring mentors. What it boiled down to for me is pride. I want every nurse to be proud of their profession, every time they go to work. I want nurses to be respected for the care they deliver and the difference they make to every patient they meet. That\u2019s why I went into nursing \u2013 I wanted to make a difference and it was clear from seeing those who were shortlisted, were highly commended or who won that they are all making a real difference in their chosen professional field. Nursing is a career with so many opportunities and these increase and diversify all the time. Thanks to the unique role that nurses occupy in the NHS there are opportunities in the fields of practice, education and research. It is a privilege to be a nurse and the skill of today\u2019s nurses is to treat patients with compassion, dignity and respect and at the same time, ensure this is consistent wherever we deliver care and however complex or technologically advanced the treatment is. This calls for professional knowledge, leadership and vision all underpinned with a desire to put the patient\u2019s needs first. Share: Tweet",

      "title": "International Nurses Day \u2013 Jane Cummings | NHS England",
      "content": "Recognised around the world Florence Nightingale\u2019s birthday on 12 th May is International Nurses Day. It is always a time for nurses to gather and celebrate the role of this profession in our society, remember nurses who have died in theatres of war and reflect on what nursing means to us as individuals. This year is no exception. Hundreds of nurses gathered at Westminster Abbey for a service to commemorate Florence Nightingale\u2019s life. The former Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey spoke about his own family, which has nurses across the generations, and how he has seen personally the role of nurses develop and change alongside clinical advances. But, he also underlined the importance of care and compassion in nursing and described how nurses are uniquely placed to look out for the patient; to be kind, to listen to their worries and fears while at the same time working with the latest clinical and technical advances to deliver great care. When I was a student nurse, I had a poem on my wall called \u2018What do you see?\u2019 The poem asks nurses to look beyond the frail and ill old woman they are treating and understand the full life she has lived and how she is feeling at the end of her life. It is a cry for compassion from the nurses who are treating her. As we celebrate International Nurses Day, I have used this poem in the form of a short film acted by Virginia McKenna, to highlight this core area of our work. I became a nurse to make a difference, and delivering care with compassion and kindness is one area where nurses can really change the way patients feel. Florence Nightingale\u2019s work laid the foundations for a modern nursing profession. She set out to improve the care that nurses give, helping to save lives but also improve the quality of patients\u2019 lives. Today\u2019s nurses are the guardians of Florence Nightingale\u2019s vision. Comments on this page are now closed. Share: Tweet",

      "content": "Welcome to this special edition of the Commissioning Support Bulletin from the NHS Commissioning Board Authority. It covers the outcome of \u2018Checkpoint 2\u2019 and the report on the process which we have published today. Clearly CSS teams put an incredible amount of hard work into the development of their outline business plans and defining responsive offers for CCGs, and are working hard to meet the needs and requirements of CCGs to support them through authorisation and beyond. Inevitably, some areas required further development and in others there is more work to do to ensure that CCGs\u2019 needs are being met. This will now be the focus as we start the work towards Checkpoint 3 in August. Developing viable and responsive commissioning support by April 2013 is a challenge but these results demonstrate that NHS CSSs are capable of meeting this challenge. We wish to thank all those CSS leaders and their teams, SHA cluster directors and their teams, CCG leaders and independent business people who took part in the process. We greatly appreciate your input. If you have any comments, or wish to receive the bulletin directly, please contact us at commissioningsupport@dh.gsi.gov.uk Dr Joe Rafferty Director of Commissioning Support Commissioning support services: outcome of \u2018Checkpoint 2\u2019 The NHS Commissioning Board Authority has today published a report about the outcome of the second stage in the business review process for commissioning support services (CSSs), known as \u2018Checkpoint 2\u2019. The objective of Checkpoint 2 was to assess whether emerging CSSs are on a viable and secure path and have the ability to develop a full business plan by August 2012 when they will undertake the final checkpoint, prior to a decision on hosting arrangements by the Board Authority. Twenty five regional NHS commissioning support services and the nationwide NHS Communications and Engagement Service submitted outline business plans for Checkpoint 2. The decisions are: Scenario A: CSS proceeds with medium to low issues as part of development plan South Yorkshire Staffordshire North West London Arden North Yorkshire and Humber Kent and Medway Merseyside Cheshire, Warrington and Wirral Norfolk and Waveney North East Central and East London West Yorkshire Best West (Somerset, Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire) CSS South (Southampton, Hampshire, Portsmouth and Isle of Wight) Scenario B: CSS proceeds with issues that need more rapid management Greater East Midlands Greater Manchester Cumbria and Lancashire Birmingham and Black Country Essex South London Surrey and Sussex Central Southern (Bucks, Oxfordshire, Berkshire, Gloucestershire and Swindon) Hertfordshire Scenario C: CSS stops West Mercia Peninsula (Devon and Cornwall) NHS Communications and Engagement Service CSS development plans, and plans for those CSSs which have been stopped, are currently being drawn up to ensure high quality commissioning support continues to be made available to all clinical commissioning groups (CCGs). The development plans will be binding and if the milestones in the plan are not met the Board Authority will review its support for the CSS. While CSSs are hosted by the Board Authority, it will be responsible for the financial risk. In the case of those CSSs which will not proceed beyond Checkpoint 2, the next steps will be: West Mercia and Peninsula\u2013 Strategic health authority (SHA) clusters are working with local CCGs, primary care trust clusters and CSSs to develop plans. NHS Communications and Engagement Service \u2013 An alternative business model, which will be nationally coordinated in a similar way to the other \u2018at scale\u2019 commissioning support offers, is being developed. In all three cases, there will still be a significant need for locally-based staff to deliver support services to CCGs and the main impact will be to senior management arrangements and organisation shape rather than to the roles that are available to NHS staff.

      "title": "Preparation for commissioning picks up pace \u2013 Barbara Hakin | NHS England",
      "content": "The pace is picking up now in terms of establishing CCGs, with less than ten months left until the new system goes live in April 2013. Across the country, groups of practices have been coming together and identifying the shape and configuration of their CCG. It is a fantastic achievement that these geographies are now sorted and we have emerging CCGs covering the whole of England coming forward for authorisation. The reforms are based very firmly on three key principles; that patients in their communities should be at the heart of everything we do; that clinicians should be in the driving seat in shaping services; and that we should focus on outcomes based on sound evidence. CCGs are the cornerstone of delivering these aspirations. GP practices know their patients and largely serve specific communities with whom the practice has had a relationship for many years. They already act as the hub of care for their patients; linking patients with other clinicians and ensuring that, through the registered list and the single lifelong record, all the care patients receive is coordinated in one place. This model is envied around the world and is key to delivering better care, better experience, better outcomes and improved safety. So it is only logical that these practices should be at the heart of determining how the range of local services can best meet their patients\u2019 needs. But good commissioning is mainly about bringing together all those with expertise and an interest in care in order to arrange the services which can deliver these quality outcomes. So the responsibility on the CCG to involve patients and the public, and the full range of health and social care colleagues, is huge. There is also lots going on to shape the rest of the commissioning system. This means putting in place all the elements of the NHS CB\u2019s own architecture, the national support office, regional teams and local area teams. The NHS CB will be responsible for ensuring the whole commissioning system works well together and that the \u00a380bn of taxpayers\u2019 money is turned into the best possible outcomes for patients. It will support and oversee CCGs who will have the majority of this resource, as well as commissioning specialised services, primary care, prison and military health services, as well as many public health services on behalf of Public Health England. Another key plank of the systems will be dedicated commissioning support units. While CCGs will be able to buy their support services from whoever they choose, we need to ensure they have the full range available to them from day one. Many independent and third sector organisations can offer fantastic niche commissioning support or highly sophisticated tools and products to aid commissioners. But the capacity and capability to deliver the full range of commissioning support sits with high experienced individuals currently in PCTs, and we must ensure this expertise is supported to deliver the best range of services from which CCGs can choose. In the final analysis, our success will be predicated on whether healthcare services deliver better outcomes which meet local needs, whether these services deliver integrated care, and whether local communities feel they have a real voice in shaping services which suite them. The key vehicle in ensuring this happens will be the local health and wellbeing board. These vital structures are still in their early development but need to be the focal point for communities, bringing together patient and public representatives, alongside all the players who commission or provide care in the locality, in one place in order to ascertain the needs of the population and outline the overarching strategic plan on which individual components will be based. There is still much to do in a relatively short space of time. But much is already in place, and we should be optimistic that this greater clinical and patient engagement will bring about the changes we need to see in order to keep improving the quality of care in this difficult economic environment. GPs and their practices have been placed centre stage in this arena in a way we have never seen previously. CCGs will only be successful if the majority of practices seize this opportunity and make the CCG their own. Their leaders are already emerging, trusted to oversee much of the day to day aspects of clinical commissioning. But without the support of the majority of their practice colleagues their task will be too great. It is the action of all GPs and their practice teams through their connection with their patients, and all others who care for them, which will create a wealth of collective experience which will make the difference.

      "title": "The Power of Information | NHS England",
      "content": "The Government is setting out its ten-year strategy for transforming the way patients get and use information about their health. The Power of Information sets out plans to give all patients easy and continuous access to their own health records by 2015. From next year people can choose the best care for themselves and their families using a new website that covers the NHS, community services and social care. The NHS Commissioning Board Authority is developing a programme of work to deliver key elements of the information strategy through NHS organisations. The vision set out in The Power of Information is that patients are in control of the information they need to improve their health and wellbeing and NHS information systems are designed to support clinicians and other front-line staff to deliver safe, high quality care to their patients. Key elements of the strategy include: A commitment that, by 2015, anyone in England will be able to access their GP health record online as well as book appointments with their GP or request repeat prescriptions online A longer-term commitment that all health and care records held by hospitals and other service providers will be made securely available to patients, enabling them to become much more involved and in control of their own healthcare A new national website will give people access to information about NHS, public health and social care services. This will include information on conditions, symptoms, treatments and the quality and range of services available, so that patients can make properly informed choices about their care The NHS will help patients and the public to get and understand the information they need, particularly for those people who are unable to access online information. This will involve the NHS working closely in partnership with other organisations, particularly in the voluntary sector Patients will be able to leave feedback on their experiences of NHS services, both online and in other ways, and NHS organisations will listen to this feedback and act on it The way information is recorded in patients\u2019 records will be accurate, consistent and standardised. This will both improve the quality of data available for patient care and also reduce over time the need for time consuming and costly additional data collections There will be clear national standards in place to ensure that locally developed IT systems can \u201ctalk\u201d to each other and exchange information effectively and securely Technology will be used to give patients high quality and convenient care \u2013 whether this be telehealth monitoring equipment that can be put in people\u2019s homes or equipment such as digital pens or clinical websites that make the working lives of NHS staff much easier and more efficient NHS organisations will be encouraged to have a clinical information champion on their Boards to promote the importance of IT skills and training across the NHS workforce, for clinicians and front-line staff as well as IT professionals The Power of Information is available on the Department of Health website at http://informationstrategy.dh.gov.uk/ . It is also available in an easy read version and is supported by an online library of good practice case studies, video testimonies and equalities and impact assessments.

A paper going to the 31 May 2012 board meeting outlines how all 212 proposed CCG applicants have now agreed their wave. Applications for CCG authorisation will take place from July to November 2012 and the NHS Commissioning Board is on schedule to have completed the authorisation process by January 2013. The wave process will comprise: 35 proposed CCGs in wave one; 70 in wave two; 67 in wave three; and 40 in wave four. The majority of proposed CCGs were able to secure their first choice of wave, but as applications for wave two exceeded availability, some were asked to move into an alternative. These moves were agreed between the proposed CCG and the SHA cluster. Proposed CCGs in each wave will continue to develop throughout the year as they take on increasing responsibilities and may have conditions set to enable them to prepare fully \u2013 irrespective of the wave they are in. All CCGs will take on their new commissioning duties, if authorised, on 1 April 2013. The Board Authority will continue to work with all proposed CCGs over the coming months, providing them with a comprehensive package of development and support to ensure they are in a strong position to take on their full responsibilities by April 2013. The authorisation process will ensure that CCGs are able to commission safely, to discharge responsibly their stewardship of the majority of the NHS budget, and to exercise their functions in relation to improving quality, reducing inequality and delivering improved health outcomes within the available resources. Each proposed CCG must develop a clear and credible commissioning plan for its local area to be able to progress through the authorisation process and become an authorised CCG.

      "content": "As I boarded the first train of the day the rain was clearing, the dawn chorus was warming up and Leeds seemed a long way away. It may well be that all roads eventually lead to Leeds, but they seem to take a lot longer than the ones that lead to London. Still \u2026. needs must and at least the section of my journey from Kings Cross to Leeds offers some protected time before anyone else has started work, to clear some unread emails in my inbox. Shortly after leaving Kings Cross the train manager wandered through the carriage checking tickets as usual but sounding remarkably more cheerful, not the normal demeanour of a train manager out to reject any \u201cAdvances\u201d that are for a different time! As he punched through my ticket I enquired as to the reason for his cheerful disposition; to which he remarked, \u201cAt my age waking up in the morning is a bonus!\u201d. It left me wondering whether lowering my expectations might make me happier \u2026. the train was running and on time! I felt strangely uplifted! Leeds was drier and less blustery than home, which in itself was unusual and exceeded my expectation. It made the walk from the station up to Quarry House all the more enjoyable. Lowering my expectations seemed to be working. On the FDG agenda today was Organisational Development of NHS CB. Oh to be a fly on the wall \u2026. I was buzzing! The mood was very relaxed, if I had kicked off my shoes and allowed my toes to enjoy the resulting freedom I would not have felt out of place. However, it soon transpired that there had been a discussion on today\u2019s subject matter the day before involving almost everyone else apart from me. Where was this going? Old habits dying hard? Unfortunately, I was unable to enjoy the invariable warm glow of indignation as the previous day\u2019s discussion seemed to have moved the whole debate to a much more interesting place, or had I just lowered my expectations? Despite this unexpected positivity it was still proving difficult to get a handle on what was understood with respect to the new behaviours that NHS CB required from its staff and how would these would be reflected across the whole of the NHS CB. First impressions last and the first experience that CCGs will have of local NHS CB offices could have a significant impact on the success of the relationship in the future, they have to be at least good enough to enable that. Whilst nobody in the room seemed to underestimate that challenge only time will tell whether anyone is prepared to shy away from it. What followed was less of a self-fulfilling naval gaze on internal development, and more of a pragmatic journey through the need for new behaviours to be modelled from the top right from the start and agreement that actions should speak louder, and earlier, than words; watch this space. Then Jack Welch joined the meeting with a conundrum that threatened to undo all of the good work. How do you approach the problem of those people who exhibit behaviours that are inconsistent with the values of the organisation but deliver the bottom line? The Fair Trade Coffee suddenly tasted a little less smooth. It turns out that Jack has had quite a lot to say for himself in the past including \u201cGetting every employee\u2019s mind into the game is a huge part of what a CEO job is all about. Taking everyone\u2019s best ideas and transferring them to others is the secret. There\u2019s nothing more important.\u201d We\u2019ll have to wait and see what influence Jack has on the future of NHS CB as it reflects on its internal development whilst drawing on the insight of key partners and external influences to help shape itself. The trick will be to walk the walk rather than just talk the talk. The bad news is that everyone seems to expect the NHS CB to trip and fall, \u201cplus ca change, plus c\u2019est la meme chose\u201d, said Jacques? The good news for NHS CB is that with such low expectations it should make it much easier to deliver enough to make us all happier as a result. Perhaps our expectations should be greater?

      "content": "Contents Welcome from Barbara Hakin Proposed CCG configuration and member practices published CCG indicative running cost allowances CCG authorisation waves agreed CCG authorisation: Wave 1 workshops CCG authorisation: Recruitment of assessors Assessment centres and development process underway Commissioning support services pass second stage of review Communications and engagement commissioning support services Commissioning support: Informed customer events for CCGs NHS Commissioning Board: New appointments and organisational design Any qualified provider Payment by results: a new guide Free places offered to CCGs at commissioning conferences Welcome from Barbara Hakin Welcome to the latest bulletin for proposed CCGs. In this issue we\u2019ve got the welcome news that the proposed configuration and member practices for 212 proposed CCGs has been published for the first time. We\u2019re also publishing the indicative running cost allowances and the proposed CCG applicants for the four authorisation waves. This information is contained in a paper for the NHS Commissioning Board Authority\u2019s board meeting on 31 May 2012. Taken together, this is a real landmark in our work to establish the new clinical commissioning system and proposed CCGs are to be congratulated on the progress they are making. It means that we now have planning assumptions for every practice in the country, every practice is now part of a proposed CCG, and every proposed CCG has a settled geography and a date scheduled for its authorisation application. Most importantly, it means that everyone living in England will be covered by a CCG from April 2013. It is important to emphasise at this point that for patients registered with a GP practice, the responsible commissioner will be the CCG of which that practice is a member. For unregistered patients, the responsible commissioner will be the CCG in whose area they live. CCGs will also be responsible for providing for emergency and urgent care for those within their boundary at the time of need. I also want to emphasise strongly that all the authorisation waves are equal and there is no difference between a CCG in wave one or wave four in terms of competence as I know from my visits to proposed CCGs. Proposed CCGs in each wave will continue to develop throughout the year as they take on increasing responsibilities, and could have conditions set irrespective of the wave in which they are placed. There is no advantage in being part of any particular wave as all CCGs will take on their new commissioning duties, if authorised, on 1 April 2013, regardless of their wave. We will continue to support proposed CCGs in a number of different ways as they continue their journey towards April 2013, and more information about leadership development and authorisation workshops is included in this bulletin. I talk to proposed CCG leaders each week and I know one of the issues that is still being discussed by many of you is identifying the nurse and doctor on the governing body of a CCG. The individual should have no conflicts of interest and so should not be employed by any organisation from which the CCG secures any significant volume of provision. When interpreting what might be considered to be a \u2018significant volume\u2019 proposed CCGs will need to include circumstances where contracts have been agreed between a CCG and a provider routinely to provide services for patients, but would not include occasional arrangements which a CCG made with a provider as a result of an individual patient exercising free choice. You may have already heard that earlier this month we published the outcome of the second stage in the business review process for commissioning support services (CSSs), known as \u2018Checkpoint 2\u2019. As part of this process, 25 regional NHS commissioning support services and the nationwide NHS Communications and Engagement Service submitted outline business plans and 23 CSSs were given the go-ahead to proceed. This is good news for the vast majority of areas and, while there are still significant challenges ahead, provides a solid basis on which proposed CCGs can now proceed in terms of agreeing plans for commissioning support. As you know we will shortly be appointing the managing directors to these 23 services and this will be another substantial step forward. There is more detail in the bulletin story below, but I\u2019m also keen to highlight the next steps for communications and engagement commissioning support services as the proposed nationwide single organisation is not considered to be the right model. Communications and engagement services are an essential part of commissioning support and will continue as an \u2018at scale\u2019 offer. However, it is clear that the proposal of a single, national organisation did not win support from proposed CCGs and we have taken this feedback on board. The new proposals are being developed with CCG involvement which will build on the good work that has been done by all communications staff over recent months. These will be available in June in line with the rest of the CSS development process. Finally, I held two webinars at the beginning of May for CCG leaders (if you missed them you can download them here ) and will be holding two more on 4 July. In addition to those I am now also blogging! I\u2019ll be jotting down my thoughts on various topics over the next few months on the NHS CBA website , along with other Commissioning Board colleagues. There is still much to do in a short time and, as always, if you have any questions, comments or feedback about the commissioning development programme, or you would like to be added to the mailing list to receive this bulletin directly, please email me at pathfinderlearningnetwork@nhs.net . Dame Barbara Hakin National Director for Commissioning Development Proposed CCG configuration and member practices published The NHS Commissioning Board Authority has published the proposed configuration and member practices for 212 proposed CCGs for the first time. This is a major step forward in the work to establish the new clinical commissioning landscape by April 2013, and, along with the publication of the running cost allowances (see story below), will enable proposed CCGs to further develop their organisation ready for authorisation and establishment. The information is in a paper for the Board Authority which will be asked to agree the configuration as the basis of authorisation at its board meeting on 31 May 2012. National and regional CCG maps have been published on the Board Authority\u2019s website at the same time. The paper confirms that there are now proposed CCGs covering the whole of England and includes the detailed geographic areas for each for the first time, plus the planning assumptions about the member practices in each proposed CCG. This means that everyone living in England will be covered by a CCG. These planning assumptions will allow work to progress. Once the NHS Commissioning Board is established as a statutory body, it will check that legal requirements have been met and approve the final details of geography and names of CCGs through the authorisation process. Each proposed CCG has determined its own configuration within the framework set out by the Board Authority, which ensures that: there is sign up from member practices there is appropriate geographical coverage that allows a proposed CCG to take on responsibility for commissioning for a population where a proposed CCG straddles upper tier or unitary local authority boundaries, it is for patient interest reasons each proposed CCG is a viable organisation in terms of the degree of sharing of roles and functions, or the use of commissioning support that it will need to consider A full list of proposed CCGs and the national and regional maps can be seen on the Board Authority\u2019s website. CCG indicative running cost allowances The NHS Commissioning Board Authority has published the indicative running cost allowances for 212 proposed CCGs for 2013-14 in a paper for noting by the Board Authority\u2019s board meeting on 31 May. The running cost allowance for CCGs has already been set at upto \u00a325 per head of population per year. This limit ensures that spending on running costs will be kept to a reasonable level and NHS funding will be focused on providing high quality services for patients and the public. The Board Authority has decided that the fairest approach to calculating running cost allowances for CCGs is to base them on the GP registered lists for practices within the CCG, but moderated at local authority level to match the Office for National Statistics\u2019 (ONS) population projection. This ensures that the aggregate population figures match the ONS estimate of the England population, and helps take account of the unregistered population. A full list of the indicative running costs allowances for each proposed CCG for 2013/14 can be seen on the NHS CBA website . CCG authorisation waves agreed The NHS Commissioning Board Authority is being asked to approve the timing of the four CCG authorisation waves. A paper going to its 31 May 2012 board meeting outlines how all 212 proposed CCG applicants have now agreed their authorisation wave and publishes the full set of four waves. Applications for CCG authorisation will take place from July to November 2012 and the NHS Commissioning Board is on schedule to have completed the authorisation process by January 2013. The wave process will comprise: 35 proposed CCGs in wave one; 70 in wave two; 67 in wave three; and 40 in wave four. The majority of proposed CCGs were able to secure their first choice of wave but, as applications for wave two exceeded availability, some were asked to move into an alternative. These moves were agreed between the proposed CCG and the SHA cluster. Proposed CCGs in each wave will continue to develop throughout the year as they take on increasing responsibilities and may have conditions set to enable them to prepare fully \u2013 irrespective of the wave they are in. All CCGs will take on their new commissioning duties, if authorised, on 1 April 2013. The Board Authority will continue to work with all proposed CCGs over the coming months, providing them with a comprehensive package of development and support to ensure they are in a strong position to take on their full responsibilities by April 2013. This will include: The applicants\u2019 guide (published in April 2012) Regional authorisation \u2018surgeries\u2019 (see story below) A full data profile for their area An assessors\u2019 guide A knowledge portal website Support materials and guidance The leadership development and assessment process. The authorisation process will ensure that CCGs are able to commission safely, to discharge responsibly their stewardship of the majority of the NHS budget, and to exercise their functions in relation to improving quality, reducing inequality and delivering improved health outcomes within the available resources. Each proposed CCG must develop a clear and credible commissioning plan for its local area to be able to progress through the authorisation process and become an authorised CCG. The full list of the proposed CCGs in each application wave can be seen on the NHS CBA website . CCG authorisation: Wave 1 workshops Two workshops are being held later this month for those proposed CCGs which are in the first wave of applications for authorisation. Up to four delegates from each emerging CCG are being invited to the day-long events on 28 May in London and 30 May in Leeds. Content at each session will cover the authorisation process in some detail, including how evidence will be assessed and decisions will be made; and identification of support. There will also be Q&A sessions and breakout sessions covering topics in more detail. All wave 1 applicants should have received an invite letter to the workshops. If not, they should contact their regional authorisation lead. Dates will be published shortly for similar workshops for those proposed CCGs in waves two, three and four. CCG authorisation: Recruitment of assessors The recruitment of assessors for the desktop review elements of the CCG authorisation process will begin this week. Their role will be to ensure that the evidence submitted by proposed CCGs is assessed transparently, consistently and fairly. NHS managers and clinicians with appropriate skills and experience in document assessment will be invited to apply via the NHS Commissioning Board Authority\u2019s website soon. SHA clusters will be asked to co-ordinate the recruitment of assessors and assessors will receive training and accreditation before they start work, covering: their specific role and function within the CCG authorisation process the overarching principles, approach and methodology of the assessment process the key stages of assessment, and the requisite outputs of each stage the published domain definitions, criteria and authorisation thresholds as set out in the applicants\u2019 guide and how to assess proposed CCGs\u2019 evidence submissions against them. An Assessors\u2019 Guide for the desktop review work which will be published shortly. It will be an accompaniment to Clinical commissioning group authorisation: Draft guide for applicants. Assessment centres and development process underway Further places are being released on a rolling basis for the CCG leadership assessment centres process and future CCG leaders are being encouraged to sign up if they haven\u2019t already booked a place. Prospective CCG leaders are guaranteed a place that fits with their authorisation timetable, and the aim is to ensure that those who are shortlisted for a CCG leadership post, but have not been through an assessment centre, have the chance to do so. Individuals wishing to take part should complete the online preparatory work as soon as they are able, even if they don\u2019t yet have a date for the assessment centre. The leadership assessment process got underway in March and there has been a high uptake of both the assessment centre places and the development offers. If anyone has any queries or needs assistance please contact the Hay Group helpline at NHSCCGassessment@haygroup.com or 0161 831 2478. Commissioning support services pass second stage of review Twenty three NHS commissioning support services will this week receive development plans which will outline the progress they need to make by August 2012. The plans will be followed up by discussions with the NHS Commissioning Board Authority during early June. The Board Authority published a report on 14 May about the overall outcome of the second stage in the business review process for commissioning support services (CSSs), known as \u2018Checkpoint 2\u2019, and the development plans are the final part of the process. The objective of Checkpoint 2 was to assess whether emerging CSSs are on a viable and secure path and have the ability to develop a full business plan by August 2012 when they will undertake the final checkpoint, prior to a decision on hosting arrangements by the Board Authority. Twenty five regional NHS commissioning support services and the nationwide NHS Communications and Engagement Service submitted outline business plans for Checkpoint 2 and 23 were given the go-ahead to proceed. The decisions were: Scenario A: CSS proceeds with medium to low issues as part of development plan South Yorkshire Staffordshire North West London Arden North Yorkshire and Humber Kent and Medway Merseyside Cheshire, Warrington and Wirral Norfolk and Waveney North East Central and East London West Yorkshire Best West (Somerset, Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire) CSS South (Southampton, Hampshire, Portsmouth and Isle of Wight) Scenario B: CSS proceeds with issues that need more rapid management Greater East Midlands Greater Manchester Cumbria and Lancashire Birmingham and Black Country Essex South London Surrey and Sussex Central Southern (Bucks, Oxfordshire, Berkshire, Gloucestershire and Swindon) Hertfordshire Scenario C: CSS stops West Mercia Peninsula (Devon and Cornwall) NHS Communications and Engagement Service The development plans will be binding and if the milestones in the plan are not met the Board Authority will review its support for the CSS. While CSSs are hosted by the Board Authority, it will be responsible for the financial risk. In the case of those CSSs which will not proceed beyond Checkpoint 2, the next steps will be: West Mercia and Peninsula \u2013 SHA clusters are working with local CCGs, primary care trust clusters and CSSs to develop new arrangements for both areas. NHS Communications and Engagement Service \u2013 See story below. The outcomes of the business review and assurance process for the \u2018at scale\u2019 commissioning support service offers will be published in June and be added to CSS development plans by the end of June. Communications and engagement commissioning support services Further to the story above, the next steps have been agreed to develop a revised operating model for communications and engagement services to support future commissioners. A \u2018hub and spoke\u2019 model \u2013 similar to that of the other \u2018at scale\u2019 CSSs \u2013 will be developed which links all CSS and CCGs across England, maps onto local engagement services, ensures staff are based appropriately in relation to local communities, and concentrates at scale work and additional communications expertise in a small number of hubs, not likely to exceed four to six. It is envisaged the model will incorporate local delivery teams and \u2018at scale\u2019 services delivered to a set of professional and measurable service standards through the commissioning support community. The next steps are: The setting up of an oversight group with CSS and CCG representation which will design the quality criteria and standards, develop the service lines, and develop a set of criteria that can be used to identify those services that can be done best at scale, and those more suited to local delivery. SHA Directors of Communications and Directors of Commissioning Development are asked to work with CSS leads and CCGs to undertake a rapid analysis and understanding of local communications and engagement services in their area, including those services offered by local authorities. Once the quality standards have been developed by the oversight group, SHA clusters will work with emerging CSS leaders to create proposals for the hub and spoke model. The aim is to do this in a coordinated way, which allows a very small number of CSSs to emerge as the hosts for the hubs, having worked in conjunction with the other CSS in their area in order to maintain local buy-in. CSSs will then be asked to express an interest in offering local and at scale services and bid to deliver communications and engagement services in a similar way to the other at scale services. This work will take place during June and July and a final decision will be made by the NHS Commissioning Board Authority in late July, ahead of the Checkpoint 3 process. The freedom of CCGs to choose their supplier of choice for commissioning support services, including communications and engagement, and the option to build or share support services in-house, remains as before and is unaffected by any proposed new operating model. Commissioning support: Informed customer events for CCGs Proposed CCG leaders are being encouraged to sign up for the \u2018informed customer\u2019 workshops which will help them determine what they need from commissioning support services. The workshops have been set up for 29 May in London and 7 June in Leeds and the programme and booking details are available online. The events will cover: Key issues and considerations for emerging CCGs on procuring CSS resources An update on the latest developments in commissioning support Feedback from the first real-time commissioning support simulation exercise involving six proposed CCGs and four CSSs Practical steps to help emerging CCGs plan their services The events are being run by the NHS Clinical Commissioners (NHS Alliance and NAPC) and Primary Care Commissioning on behalf of the NHS Commissioning Board Authority. NHS Commissioning Board: New appointments and organisational design The NHS Commissioning Board Authority announced the appointment of its final National Director and four Regional Directors earlier this month. They are: National Director for Patients and Information: Tim Kelsey, currently Executive Director of Transparency and Open Data for HM Government Regional Director, North of England: Richard Barker, currently Chief Operating Officer, NHS North of England Regional Director, Midlands and the East: Dr Paul Watson,currently Chief Executive, NHS Suffolk Regional Director, London: Dr Anne Rainsberry,currently Chief Executive, NHS North West London and Deputy Chief Executive, NHS London Regional Director, South of England: Andrea Young,currently Chief Operating Officer / Deputy Chief Executive, NHS South of England The four Regional Directors will be part of the senior leadership team of the Operations Directorate, reporting directly to the Chief Operating Officer. They are working with primary care trusts, strategic health authorities and other stakeholders to co-design a proposal for the final model of the Commissioning Board\u2019s network of local area teams. An update will be given at the Board meeting on 31 May. The Operations Directorate is now using the term \u2018regions\u2019 instead of \u2018sectors\u2019 and \u2018local area teams\u2019 instead of \u2018local offices\u2019 \u2013 and there will be fewer than the 50 that were initially proposed. Each team will have the same core functions around CCG development and assurance; emergency planning, resilience, and response; the strategic assurance of quality and patient safety locally; partnerships; service transformation and configuration and oversight of the local NHS and care system. There will be variations in the scope of their direct commissioning responsibilities as follows: All local area teams will have responsibilities for GP, dental and pharmacy services Around one-third of the teams will lead on specialised commissioning A smaller number of teams will have responsibilities for optometric, military health and offender health services. The commissioning of some public health services is likely to be done to a larger geography than local area teams (for example screening programmes) while others are likely to be done at local area team level (for example public health services for the under 5s). Any qualified provider From 2013-14 CCGs will be able to decide when, where, and how to use competition to drive up quality, enable innovation and improve services. They will be able to choose the service areas to which patient choice of provider will be extended locally, based on local needs and priorities and informed by engagement with patients and clinicians. With this in mind, earlier this week a group of proposed CCG leaders took part in a national event to demonstrate how Any Qualified Provider (AQP) forms part of the commissioners\u2019 toolkit and can be used \u2013 along with other forms of procurement \u2013 to improve services for patients and enable innovation. Delegates explored the opportunities and challenges of extending patient choice of AQP from 2013 onwards, and how this would help them prepare for authorisation. The day focused on key themes such as: Why and when to use patient choice of AQP What commissioning support will CCGs need AQP qualification: how to assure quality and patient safety Addressing concerns about service fragmentation, demand management and price setting GPs as providers: can they be part of AQP In addition, PCT clusters are on track to deliver the NHS Operating Framework 2012-13 requirement to offer patients choice of AQP in at least three services in line with local priorities in 2012-13. Commissioners have identified a range of 28 different services and the vast majority of commissioners have already committed to offering choice in at least three services by September 2012. A number of PCTs have also engaged further with CCGs, aiming to better reflect CCG priorities for the future. Payment by results: a new guide Payment by Results (PbR) is the payment system in England under which commissioners pay healthcare providers for each patient seen or treated. Activity covered by PbR tariffs and currencies covers an increasing proportion of commissioner spend on acute healthcare. It is essential that clinical commissioning groups (CCGs), commissioning support services (CSSs) and local clinical leads have an understanding of PbR. For newcomers, this simple guide is a good place to start. For more information go to http://healthandcare.dh.gov.uk/payment-by-results/ Free places offered to CCGs at commissioning conferences The NHS Commissioning Board Authority will have a presence at two major conferences next month \u2013 the NHS Confederation annual conference and exhibition in Manchester on 20-22 June and the Commissioning Show 2012 in London on 27-28 June. As well as an exhibition stand at each event, there will also be a number of speakers and workshops to guide delegates through the essential commissioning reforms taking place this year. Both events are also offering special deals to proposed CCGs. The NHS Confederation is offering one free conference pass to each CCG when they register with the NHS Confederation. Call 0844 800 5987 or email annualconference2012@nhsconfed.org to book your place. Meanwhile in partnership with the NHS Alliance and the NAPC, there is also a limited allocation of free passes for CCGs for the Commissioning Show. Send an e-mail with \u2018BOOK COMM 12\u2019 in the subject line to a.andrews@closerstillmedia.com to book your place. Comments on this page are now closed. Share: Tweet",

The information is in a paper for the Board Authority which will be asked to agree the proposed configuration as the basis of authorisation at its board meeting on 31 May 2012. National and regional CCG maps displaying the information are also available. The paper confirms that there are now proposed CCGs covering the whole of England and includes the detailed geographic areas for each for the first time, plus the planning assumptions about the member practices in each proposed CCG (using April 2011 data). This means that everyone living in England will be covered by a CCG from April 2013. These planning assumptions will allow work to progress. Once the NHS Commissioning Board is established as a statutory body, it will check that legal requirements have been met and approve the final details of geography, names and member practices of CCGs through the authorisation process. Each proposed CCG has determined its own configuration within the framework set out by the Board Authority, which ensures that: there is sign up from member practices there is appropriate geographical coverage that allows a proposed CCG to take on responsibility for commissioning for a population where a proposed CCG straddles upper tier or unitary local authority boundaries, it is for patient interest reasons each proposed CCG is a viable organisation in terms of the degree of sharing of roles and functions, or the use of commissioning support that it will need to consider Dame Barbara Hakin, National Director of Commissioning Development at the NHS Commissioning Board Authority, said, \u201cThis is a real landmark moment and is a credit to everyone involved in developing CCGs and the new clinically-led commissioning system. \u201cWe should not underestimate the hard work that has taken place to get us where we are and the huge progress that has been made across the country. We have proposed CCGs covering the whole of England. We have 212 groups of practices who have chosen to come together to shape and commission services to deliver better care, better experience, better outcomes and improved safety for their local populations. \u201cThere is still a great deal of work to do as the proposed CCGs move closer to authorisation, but we should take a moment to celebrate this fantastic achievement.\u201d List of proposed CCGs with names, populations, current PCTs and running cost allowances List of proposed CCGs with proposed known constituent member practices See the national and regional maps of proposed CCGs .

      "content": "The report of a customer survey, which was carried out with proposed clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) and NHS commissioning support services (CSSs) has been published today. The findings show that the over 90% of proposed CCGs are very or quite confident that the arrangements they are putting in place for commissioning support will allow them to achieve authorisation. Just over a half say they expect to source at least 50% of their commissioning support through NHS CSSs, with around a further quarter sourcing 30%-49%. The report also suggests that the majority of CCGs intend to carry on with the same CSS during 2012/13, with one in ten wanting to exercise choice; although they do want more information on choice and advice on how to access procure support. Although the findings suggest that more could be done to ensure CSS objectives are aligned to those of the CCGs they will support, most proposed CCGs say they feel engaged with, and involved in, the development of their local CSS. The survey was conducted in March and April 2012 as part of the arrangements to support the second stage in the business review process for CSSs, known as Checkpoint 2. The outcome of Checkpoint 2 was published on 14 May and the 23 NHS CSSs which are progressing through to Checkpoint 3 will this week receive their development plans which outline the progress they will need to make by August 2012. Overall, the Checkpoint 2 process found that CSSs had good leadership and good levels of engagement in developing their customer focus, but a need to further develop their business focus. Milestones in the plans will be agreed at meetings with the Board Authority in May and June. These will be binding and each CSS will have monthly progress check with the Board Authority. Joe Rafferty, Director of Commissioning Support, said: \u201cThe commissioning support survey results have been taken account of and work is already well underway to address the points that were identified. Overall, we know from Checkpoint 2 that CSSs are on track, but clearly there are some key areas \u2013 such as supporting those CCGs which want to exercise their choice of commissioning support, and ensuring CSSs provide greater innovation \u2013 which need further development.\u201d CSS managing directors are due to be appointed from late June and will further strengthen the CSS leadership teams. The survey was led by the Clinical Commissioning Coalition (comprising the National Association of Primary Care and the NHS Alliance) on behalf of the NHS Commissioning Board Authority to provide an independent view of how the services and the relationships between emerging CSSs and CCGs are developing. Independent research agency TNS-BRMB carried out the work. The survey was sent to all proposed CCGs, with a 66 per cent response rate. All 25 CSSs included in Checkpoint 2 took part.

This month I\u2019m pleased to say we\u2019ve got the chance to hear from Sir David Nicholson and Dame Barbara Hakin as well as updates on the Checkpoint 2 commissioning support service (CSS) development plans, the future for communications and engagement services, and the external recruitment process for the important CSS managing director posts. We\u2019ve also got more information on the CCG running costs allowances and how these are calculated. Of course, the outcome of Checkpoint 2 has been a huge milestone for all of us and I\u2019m sure many of you are still taking the full implications on board. Every CSS will this week receive a development plan and these will help to focus our approach and provide a route map for the next steps to Checkpoint 3. Of course, it is a massive challenge to complete the necessary steps by August but we should approach our task with confidence. We took the serious step of stopping three CSSs in Checkpoint 2 and this will have been difficult news for the people in those organisations. I wish again to reassure those staff who are affected that there will still be a significant need for locally-based staff to deliver support services to clinical commissioning groups (CCGs). The main impact will be to senior management arrangements and organisation shape rather than to the roles that are available to NHS staff. We will shortly to be able to update you on the new arrangements forWest MerciaandPeninsula; and the senior communications leaders, who have done such a great job in defining much of the model for communications, are already working with local CSS leaders on how to build this model into CSS arrangements. The coming months are absolutely critical \u2013 there is a lot to manage and no room for complacency. Nevertheless I am optimistic. The landscape is changing and there is a huge opportunity for CSSs to prove themselves to potential customers. Thank you again for taking part so constructively in the process. Please keep in touch and let us know what you think. To send us your comments, or join our mailing list, please contact us at commissioningsupport@dh.gsi.gov.uk Dr Joe Rafferty Director of Commissioning Support CSS Learning Network engages with Sir David Nicholson and Dame Barbara Hakin CSS leaders met with Sir David Nicholson and Dame Barbara Hakin at the monthly CSS Learning Network meeting, run by the NHS Commissioning Board Authority, on24 May 2012. The Board Authority Chief Executive and National Director for Commissioning Development listened to the views of CSS leaders and answered key questions on the future form of CSSs and the transition to the Board Authority. In the session Sir David emphasised that CSSs were \u201ccritical to the success of the new clinical commissioning system\u201d and highlighted that the current private sector market was unlikely to be able to provide more than around five per cent of the support that would be needed initially, before thanking CSSs for their work so far. He said: \u201cThe real work starts now and the key focus must be on developing new and effective ways to deliver high quality NHS services. We need to have a fully-functioning, dynamic commissioning support sector in place.\u201d Sir David also emphasised the importance of communications and engagement commissioning support services, which would help with coordination across the whole commissioning system. He said: \u201cWe will be seeking a new business model that provides appropriate connectivity across the system based in common NHS values, principles and behaviours.\u201d On the future form of CSSs he said the Board Authority would be guided by CSSs and that a range of models including social enterprises and joint ventures would be explored. Sir David also told CSSs how impressed he had been with the CCG survey which highlighted CCGs\u2019 appreciation of their services. Dame Barbara highlighted the \u201cremarkable journey\u201d that CSSs were on and said the Checkpoint 2 process had shown they were doing a \u201cfantastic job\u201d in creating viable organisations. She said: \u201cWe are about to see a significant step forward as CSSs implement their development plans and permanent leaders are appointed. The success of the new system is as dependent on these organisations as it is on CCGs and we must set the bar high for these senior appointments.\u201d She said that CSSs would operate at arms-length from day-to-day Board Authority business, and that every attempt would be made to make the units feel as autonomous as possible. Dame Barbara also commended the CSSs on their increasingly good relationships with CCGs, and added that she was hearing increasingly from local authorities that they felt more positive about joint working. Mike Farrar, Chief Executive of the NHS Confederation, also attended the network meeting and discussed with the CSS leaders how the NHS Confederation could provide support to their learning network. Recruitment of managing directors for CSSs The assessment centres for the CSS managing director posts will start on 29 May and run for three days. Interviews will follow in mid-June and appointments will be made from later that month. Now that the first recruitment phase has reached the shortlist stage, the external recruitment phase will begin and a national job advertisement is due to appear shortly. The appointments will be made by a panel chaired by Dame Barbara Hakin, National Managing Director for Commissioning Development at the NHS Commissioning Board Authority, as CSSs will be hosted by the Board Authority for up to three years. The next level of recruitment will be led by CSS managing directors. CCG indicative running cost allowances The NHS Commissioning Board Authority has published the indicative running cost allowances for 212 proposed CCGs for 2013-14 in a paper for the Board Authority\u2019s board meeting on 31 May. The running costs allowance for CCGs has already been set at up to \u00a325 per head of population per year. This limit meets the requirement to reduce system wide administration costs by one third, and ensures spending on running costs is kept to a reasonable level and NHS funding is focused on providing high quality services for patients and the public. The Board Authority has decided that the fairest approach to calculating running costs allowances for CCGs is to base them on the GP registered lists for practices within the CCG but moderated at local authority level to match the Office for National Statistics\u2019 (ONS) population projections. This ensures that the aggregate population figures match the ONS estimate of theEnglandpopulation, and helps take account of the unregistered population. The latest ONS projections for 2013 are for a totalEnglandpopulation of 53.56m. The attribution data set (ADS), which is the source of GP list data, gives a patient population of 55.26m for practices inEnglandin April 2011. The starting point for the calculation of running costs is the patient populations for aCCG\u2019s GP practices as recorded in the ADS. This ensures that the distribution of running costs takes account of cross-boundary patient flows. It was estimated that 3.4m registered patients are not resident in the area for which their CCG has geographic responsibility. A methodology was needed to adjust these patient populations, so that together they reconcile back to the ONS England population projection of 53.56m. As a result, the total ADS population resident in each district local authority area was matched to the ONS projection for 2013 (after excluding estimated counts of military personnel). This is consistent with a long-established methodology used in PCT financial allocations. The methodology also takes account of factors such as inaccurate lists, for instance where patients no longer live in the area and are registered with a different practice, but have not yet been removed from their previous GP\u2019s list. A full list of the indicative running costs allowances for each proposed CCG for 2013-14 and the briefing note can both be found on the Board Authority\u2019s website. CSS development plans The 23 NHS CSSs will this week receive development plans which outline the progress they will need to make by August 2012. Milestones in the plans will be agreed at meetings with the NHS Commissioning Board Authority during May and early June. The milestones will be binding and each CSS will have a monthly progress check with the Board Authority. If the milestones in the plan are not met the Board Authority will review its support for the CSS. Overall, the Checkpoint 2 process found that CSSs had: Good levels of leadership Good levels of engagement in developing their customer focus A need to further develop their business focus in line with the financial information being worked up. The Board Authority published a report on 14 May about the overall outcome of the second stage in the business review process for CSSs, known as Checkpoint 2, and the development plans are the final part of the checkpoint. At Checkpoint 2, key areas of strength were identified as: Established leadership team with a shared vision A clearly separated organisation, well into its transition phase, with a detailed organisational development programme Developing operational structure Matured / impressive engagement with CCG clinicians and managers Service level agreements (SLAs) in place, and developing service levels Developing customer performance monitoring Senior commercial skills in place Detailed competitor analysis and developing marketing strategy Main risks identified and mitigated. Areas for focus and development included: Insufficient management and/or commitment Need for an in-depth plan and a greater sense of pace Concern over the \u2018right-size\u2019 for the business Lack of engagement with customers Memorandums of understanding but not SLAs in place CCGs\u2019 lack of confidence in CSSs Costs unclear and lack of a pricing structure Margins unclear (income / service line) External help \u2013 only now specifying. In the case of those CSSs which will not proceed beyond Checkpoint 2 \u2013West MerciaandPeninsula\u2013 local CCGs are in discussions with the Board Authority, SHA clusters and surrounding CSSs and a new configuration will be agreed during June. The outcomes of the business review and assurance process for the \u2018at scale\u2019 commissioning support service offers will be published in June and be added to CSS development plans by the end of June. As part of the development planning process, key areas for leadership, board and organisational development have also been identified, and a wider programme of support is being created. The objective of Checkpoint 2 was to assess whether emerging CSSs are on a viable and secure path and have the ability to develop a full business plan by August 2012 when they will undertake the final checkpoint, prior to a decision on hosting arrangements by the Board Authority. Next steps for communications and engagement services Next steps have been agreed which will ensure the development of a revised operating model for communications and engagement services in line with the timescales for the business review and assurance process. A \u2018hub and spoke\u2019 model \u2013 similar to that of the other \u2018at scale\u2019 CSSs \u2013 will be developed which links all CSSs and CCGs across England, maps onto local engagement services, ensures staff are based appropriately in relation to local communities, and concentrates at scale work and additional communications expertise in a small number of hubs, not likely to exceed four to six. It is envisaged the model will incorporate local delivery teams and \u2018at scale\u2019 services delivered to a set of professional and measurable service standards through the commissioning support community. The next steps are: The setting up of an oversight group with CSS and CCG representation which will design the quality criteria and standards, develop the service lines, and develop a set of criteria that can be used to identify those services that can be done best at scale, and those more suited to local delivery. Once the quality standards have been developed by the oversight group, SHA clusters to work with emerging CSS leaders to create proposals for the hub and spoke model. The aim is to do this in a coordinated way, which allows a very small number of CSSs to emerge as the hosts for the hubs, having worked in conjunction with the other CSSs in their area in order to maintain local buy-in. SHA Directors of Communications and Directors of Commissioning Development working with CSS and CCG leaders to undertake a rapid analysis and understanding of local communications and engagement services in their area, including those services offered by local authorities. CSSs to be asked to express an interest in offering local and at scale services and bid to deliver communications and engagement services in a similar way to the other at scale services. This work will take place during June and July and a final decision will be made by the NHS Commissioning Board Authority in late July, ahead of the Checkpoint 3 process. Update on the \u2018at scale\u2019 offers CSSs are currently preparing their responses to the standards set out by the NHS Commissioning Board Authority for business intelligence integration and validation centres and healthcare (clinical) procurement services. In addition CSSs will provide information on business support services setting out how they propose to benchmark with the wider market. By 8 June each CSS must submit detailed proposals for the at scale services it wishes to provide according to the Board Authority\u2019s criteria and standards. CSSs which plan to offer business intelligence, healthcare (clinical) procurement and business support components to their customers are subject to additional tests in May and June 2012, following the Checkpoint 2 assurance process. These CSSs have already set out their working assumptions for these components within their outline business plans. By the end of June, the Board Authority will have reviewed the CSSs\u2019 submissions and identified the final configuration and development plans. Key learnings from simulation exercise Positive feedback has been gained from the first real-time commissioning support simulation exercise which took place on 17 May. The event, which involving six emerging CCGs and four CSSs, and was organised by the NHS Commissioning Board Authority with the Health Services Management Centre at the University of Birmingham and NHS Clinical Commissioners, was well attended. It created a realistic environment in which participants, through role play, explored the ways that emerging CCGs will work with CSSs to commission effectively from their providers. A full report is being prepared and will be published in June. In the meantime, the key learnings from the day were: Relationship development: CSSs and CCGs need to be clear and proactive about what is on offer, and make time to expand networks and the understanding of others\u2019 roles and responsibilities. Collaboration and competition: Important to collaborate but also a need to be clear about the legal rules, for instance regarding procurement, governance, and accountability. CCGs and CSSs need to maximise the benefits of clinically led commissioning by knowing when clinical involvement is essential, and when other members of the commissioning family have the expertise to take it from here. Key learnings from the independent sector need to be identified and shared. For instance, longer term planning, \u2018future gazing\u2019, customer focus, and approaches to risk management. Contingency planning is important as is delivering the \u2018business as usual\u2019. The emerging CCGs and CSSs were invited to reflect a range of sizes, locations and stages of development and included: CCGs inBristol,Cheshire, Cambridgeshire andPeterborough,Enfield, Mid-Sussex and Horsham, and South ofTees CSSs in North West London,East Midlands, andSouthampton, Hampshire,Isle of WightandPortsmouth; plus a team of independent sector commissioning support service providers. Two informed customer workshops will take place on 29 May in London and 7 June in Leeds and the outputs from these will be published in due course. Checkpoint 2 customer survey The report of a customer survey, which was carried out with proposed clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) and NHS commissioning support services (CSSs) has been published. The findings show that the over 90% of proposed CCGs are very or quite confident that the arrangements they are putting in place for commissioning support will allow them to achieve authorisation. Just over a half say they expect to source at least 50% of their commissioning support through NHS CSSs, with around a further quarter sourcing 30%-49%. The report also suggests that the majority of CCGs intend to carry on with the same CSS during 2012-13, with one in ten wanting to exercise choice; although they do want more information on choice and advice on how to access procure support. Although the findings suggest that more could be done to ensure CSS objectives are aligned to those of the CCGs they will support, most proposed CCGs say they feel engaged with, and involved in, the development of their local CSS. The survey was conducted in March and April 2012 as part of the arrangements to support the second stage in the business review process for CSSs, known as Checkpoint 2. The outcome of Checkpoint 2 was published on 14 May and the 23 NHS CSSs which are progressing through to Checkpoint 3 will this week receive their development plans which outline the progress they will need to make by August 2012. Overall, the Checkpoint 2 process found that CSSs had good leadership and good levels of engagement in developing their customer focus, but a need to further develop their business focus. In a statement on the Board Authority\u2019s website, Joe Rafferty, Director of Commissioning Support, said: \u201cThe commissioning support survey results have been taken account of and work is already well underway to address the points that were identified. Overall, we know from Checkpoint 2 that CSSs are on track, but clearly there are some key areas \u2013 such as supporting those CCGs which want to exercise their choice of commissioning support, and ensuring CSSs provide greater innovation \u2013 which need further development.\u201d The survey was led by the Clinical Commissioning Coalition (comprising the National Association of Primary Care and the NHS Alliance) on behalf of the NHS Commissioning Board Authority to provide an independent view of how the services and the relationships between emerging CSSs and CCGs are developing. Independent research agency TNS-BRMB carried out the work. The survey was sent to all proposed CCGs, with a 66 per cent response rate. All 25 CSSs included in Checkpoint 2 took part. A copy of the survey report can be seen on the Board Authority\u2019s website . Checkpoint 3 design and guidance The design for Checkpoint 3 design is being finalised and the guidance is due out in early June. This checkpoint will include the fourth domain \u2013 delivery \u2013 and the key governance and finance regimes. Work is also progressing on the CSS performance dashboard for agreement and implementation this summer. NHS Commissioning Board: New appointments and organisational design The NHS Commissioning Board Authority announced the appointment of its final National Director and four Regional Directors earlier this month. They are: National Director for Patients and Information Tim Kelsey currently Executive Director of Transparency and Open Data for HM Government Regional Director, North ofEngland Richard Barker currently Chief Operating Officer, NHS North of England Regional Director,Midlandsand the East Dr Paul Watson currently Chief Executive, NHS Suffolk Regional Director,London Dr Anne Rainsberry currently Chief Executive, NHS North West London and Deputy Chief Executive, NHS London Regional Director, South ofEngland Andrea Young currently Chief Operating Officer / Deputy Chief Executive, NHS South of Englan The four Regional Directors will be part of the senior leadership team of the Operations Directorate, reporting directly to the Chief Operating Officer Ian Dalton. They are working with primary care trusts, strategic health authorities and other stakeholders to co-design a proposal for the final model of the Commissioning Board\u2019s network of local area teams. An update on these will be given at the Board Authority\u2019s board meeting on 31 May. The Board Authority is now using the term \u2018regions\u2019 instead of \u2018sectors\u2019 and \u2018local area teams\u2019 instead of \u2018local offices\u2019 \u2013 and there will be fewer than the 50 that were initially proposed. Each team will have the same core functions around CCG development and assurance; emergency planning, resilience, and response; the strategic assurance of quality and patient safety locally; partnerships; service transformation and configuration; and oversight of the local NHS and care system. There will be variations in the scope of their direct commissioning responsibilities as follows: All local area teams will have responsibilities for GP, dental and pharmacy services Around one-third of the teams will lead on specialised commissioning A smaller number of teams will have responsibilities for optometric, military health and offender health services. The commissioning of some public health services is likely to be done to a larger geography than local area teams (for example screening programmes) while others are likely to be done at local area team level (for example public health services for the under fives). News in brief The Business Plan for the NHS Commissioning Board Authority is due to be published this week. The document sets out what the Board Authority will continue to do in the establishment phase up to October 2012 when it is scheduled to become an executive non-departmental public body. As part of authorisation, CCGs will be required to demonstrate that they have appropriate plans in place to procure support services by 2016. The NHS Commissioning Board Authority is producing a number of products that will provide CCGs with the tools necessary to understand procurement, available options for obtaining support, and statutory obligations. These products will form part of a consultation exercise with CCGs due to take place from the summer. To embed the underlying principles, a series of events for CCGs will also be set up. Information has been released in the last week about the configuration and authorisation applications for proposed CCGs. For more updates about this, read our latest Bulletin for proposed CCGs .

      "title": "Landmark moment on the road to authorisation \u2013 Barbara Hakin | NHS England",
      "content": "Last week we reached a real landmark moment in the journey towards developing CCGs and the new clinically-led commissioning system. As you will have heard, we now have proposed CCGs covering the whole of England. That means 212 groups of practices have chosen to come together to shape and commission services to deliver better care, better experience, better outcomes and improved safety for their local populations. We shouldn\u2019t underestimate the hard work that has taken place to get us where we are and the huge progress that has been made across the country, but there is still a great deal to do \u2013 and I\u2019m sure the pace is the same where you are. Our focus continues to be on shaping the new commissioning system so that it\u2019s ready to go live from April 2013. There\u2019s a great deal to be done collectively to prepare for this and I know from my conversations with GPs and CCG leaders recently that clinical commissioning groups are really keen to make best use of this transitional year to move to the new arrangements. Proposed CCGs are now firmly on their journeys to become fully fledged statutory organisations \u2013 made up of, and accountable to, their member practices. Authorisation is the important first step in this journey, so firstly I want to draw your attention to the draft guide for applicants for proposed CCGs which the Board Authority has published. As we\u2019ve said all along, we wanted to make the authorisation process developmental for clinicians, while at the same time balancing it with the need to monitor public funds and ensure the safety and quality of local health services for our patients. I really do think we\u2019ve achieved this and \u2013 with many CCGs\u2019 help and input \u2013 reached our goal of a rigorous but fair process. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen the document already, but if not, the draft guide provides a detailed description of the criteria, thresholds and evidence for authorisation. It sets out the timetable for applications in four waves \u2013 the first of which is only a couple of months away, starting in July. The guide is designed to help proposed CCGs prepare that application by working with their member practices, and then help them develop clear plans to progress through to become authorised CCGs. I know from speaking to aspiring CCG leaders over the last few weeks that many are already planning for the authorisation process and others are keen to do so, therefore I thought it might be useful to set out some of the logical steps that proposed CCGs can take now. They have already agreed \u2013 along with their SHA cluster \u2013 which \u2018wave\u2019 of authorisation they will be part of \u2013 and this information has also been released. We were delighted to see that so many CCGs wanted to be in wave 1, but please remember that there\u2019s no advantage or disadvantage to being part of any particular wave \u2013 all CCGs will take on their new commissioning duties, if authorised, on 1 April 2013. Next, as CCGs begin to prepare for authorisation, I\u2019d also ask them to take the time to ensure they establish sound governance arrangements, have a constitution, nominate leaders for the key roles on their governing bodies and keep all their member practices informed of the process. The next few months will be so important as we move through this process and the way the Board Authority continues to engage with and support emerging CCGs will be critical. Again, if you\u2019re not already aware, there\u2019s a great deal of tailored support available and we\u2019ll be producing more in the coming weeks. We want to see a network of successful, sustainable, authorised CCGs ready to be the best they can be for their patients and populations from April 2013. Comments on this page are now closed.

      "content": "24 May 2012 - 14:32 The NHS Commissioning Board Authority has published the proposed configuration and member practices for 212 proposed CCGs for the first time. This is a major step forward in the work to establish the new clinical commissioning landscape by April 2013, and, along with the publication of the running cost allowances, will enable proposed CCGs to further develop their organisation ready for authorisation and establishment. The information is in a paper for the Board Authority which will be asked to agree the proposed configuration as the basis of authorisation at its board meeting on 31 May 2012. National and regional CCG maps displaying the information are also available. The paper confirms that there are now proposed CCGs covering the whole of England and includes the detailed geographic areas for each for the first time, plus the planning assumptions about the member practices in each proposed CCG (using April 2011 data). This means that everyone living in England will be covered by a CCG from April 2013. These planning assumptions will allow work to progress. Once the NHS Commissioning Board is established as a statutory body, it will check that legal requirements have been met and approve the final details of geography, names and member practices of CCGs through the authorisation process. Each proposed CCG has determined its own configuration within the framework set out by the Board Authority, which ensures that: there is sign up from member practices there is appropriate geographical coverage that allows a proposed CCG to take on responsibility for commissioning for a population where a proposed CCG straddles upper tier or unitary local authority boundaries, it is for patient interest reasons each proposed CCG is a viable organisation in terms of the degree of sharing of roles and functions, or the use of commissioning support that it will need to consider Dame Barbara Hakin, National Director of Commissioning Development at the NHS Commissioning Board Authority, said, \u201cThis is a real landmark moment and is a credit to everyone involved in developing CCGs and the new clinically-led commissioning system. \u201cWe should not underestimate the hard work that has taken place to get us where we are and the huge progress that has been made across the country. We have proposed CCGs covering the whole of England. We have 212 groups of practices who have chosen to come together to shape and commission services to deliver better care, better experience, better outcomes and improved safety for their local populations. \u201cThere is still a great deal of work to do as the proposed CCGs move closer to authorisation, but we should take a moment to celebrate this fantastic achievement.\u201d List of proposed CCGs with names, populations, current PCTs and running cost allowances List of proposed CCGs with proposed known constituent member practices See the national and regional maps of proposed CCGs .

      "content": "The NHS Commissioning Board Authority is being asked to approve the timing of the four CCG authorisation waves. A paper going to the 31 May 2012 board meeting outlines how all 212 proposed CCG applicants have now agreed their wave. Applications for CCG authorisation will take place from July to November 2012 and the NHS Commissioning Board is on schedule to have completed the authorisation process by January 2013. The wave process will comprise: 35 proposed CCGs in wave one; 70 in wave two; 67 in wave three; and 40 in wave four. The majority of proposed CCGs were able to secure their first choice of wave, but as applications for wave two exceeded availability, some were asked to move into an alternative. These moves were agreed between the proposed CCG and the SHA cluster. Proposed CCGs in each wave will continue to develop throughout the year as they take on increasing responsibilities and may have conditions set to enable them to prepare fully \u2013 irrespective of the wave they are in. All CCGs will take on their new commissioning duties, if authorised, on 1 April 2013. The Board Authority will continue to work with all proposed CCGs over the coming months, providing them with a comprehensive package of development and support to ensure they are in a strong position to take on their full responsibilities by April 2013. The authorisation process will ensure that CCGs are able to commission safely, to discharge responsibly their stewardship of the majority of the NHS budget, and to exercise their functions in relation to improving quality, reducing inequality and delivering improved health outcomes within the available resources. Each proposed CCG must develop a clear and credible commissioning plan for its local area to be able to progress through the authorisation process and become an authorised CCG.

      "content": "The report of a customer survey, which was carried out with proposed clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) and NHS commissioning support services (CSSs) has been published today. The findings show that the over 90% of proposed CCGs are very or quite confident that the arrangements they are putting in place for commissioning support will allow them to achieve authorisation. Just over a half say they expect to source at least 50% of their commissioning support through NHS CSSs, with around a further quarter sourcing 30%-49%. The report also suggests that the majority of CCGs intend to carry on with the same CSS during 2012/13, with one in ten wanting to exercise choice; although they do want more information on choice and advice on how to access procure support. Although the findings suggest that more could be done to ensure CSS objectives are aligned to those of the CCGs they will support, most proposed CCGs say they feel engaged with, and involved in, the development of their local CSS. The survey was conducted in March and April 2012 as part of the arrangements to support the second stage in the business review process for CSSs, known as Checkpoint 2. The outcome of Checkpoint 2 was published on 14 May and the 23 NHS CSSs which are progressing through to Checkpoint 3 will this week receive their development plans which outline the progress they will need to make by August 2012. Overall, the Checkpoint 2 process found that CSSs had good leadership and good levels of engagement in developing their customer focus, but a need to further develop their business focus. Milestones in the plans will be agreed at meetings with the Board Authority in May and June. These will be binding and each CSS will have monthly progress check with the Board Authority. Joe Rafferty, Director of Commissioning Support, said: \u201cThe commissioning support survey results have been taken account of and work is already well underway to address the points that were identified. Overall, we know from Checkpoint 2 that CSSs are on track, but clearly there are some key areas \u2013 such as supporting those CCGs which want to exercise their choice of commissioning support, and ensuring CSSs provide greater innovation \u2013 which need further development.\u201d CSS managing directors are due to be appointed from late June and will further strengthen the CSS leadership teams. The survey was led by the Clinical Commissioning Coalition (comprising the National Association of Primary Care and the NHS Alliance) on behalf of the NHS Commissioning Board Authority to provide an independent view of how the services and the relationships between emerging CSSs and CCGs are developing. Independent research agency TNS-BRMB carried out the work. The survey was sent to all proposed CCGs, with a 66 per cent response rate. All 25 CSSs included in Checkpoint 2 took part.

      "content": "28 May 2012 - 08:42 Last week we reached a real landmark moment in the journey towards developing CCGs and the new clinically-led commissioning system. As you will have heard, we now have proposed CCGs covering the whole of England. That means 212 groups of practices have chosen to come together to shape and commission services to deliver better care, better experience, better outcomes and improved safety for their local populations. We shouldn\u2019t underestimate the hard work that has taken place to get us where we are and the huge progress that has been made across the country, but there is still a great deal to do \u2013 and I\u2019m sure the pace is the same where you are. Our focus continues to be on shaping the new commissioning system so that it\u2019s ready to go live from April 2013. There\u2019s a great deal to be done collectively to prepare for this and I know from my conversations with GPs and CCG leaders recently that clinical commissioning groups are really keen to make best use of this transitional year to move to the new arrangements. Proposed CCGs are now firmly on their journeys to become fully fledged statutory organisations \u2013 made up of, and accountable to, their member practices. Authorisation is the important first step in this journey, so firstly I want to draw your attention to the draft guide for applicants for proposed CCGs which the Board Authority has published. As we\u2019ve said all along, we wanted to make the authorisation process developmental for clinicians, while at the same time balancing it with the need to monitor public funds and ensure the safety and quality of local health services for our patients. I really do think we\u2019ve achieved this and \u2013 with many CCGs\u2019 help and input \u2013 reached our goal of a rigorous but fair process. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen the document already, but if not, the draft guide provides a detailed description of the criteria, thresholds and evidence for authorisation. It sets out the timetable for applications in four waves \u2013 the first of which is only a couple of months away, starting in July. The guide is designed to help proposed CCGs prepare that application by working with their member practices, and then help them develop clear plans to progress through to become authorised CCGs. I know from speaking to aspiring CCG leaders over the last few weeks that many are already planning for the authorisation process and others are keen to do so, therefore I thought it might be useful to set out some of the logical steps that proposed CCGs can take now.

      "content": "The NHS Commissioning Board Authority has today published the results of the second stage in the business review process for commissioning support services (CSSs), known as \u2018Checkpoint 2\u2019. The objective of Checkpoint 2 is to assess whether emerging CSSs are on a viable and secure path and have the ability to develop a full business plan by August 2012 when they will undertake the final checkpoint, prior to a decision on hosting arrangements by the Board Authority. Twenty five regional NHS commissioning support services and the nationwide NHS Communications and Engagement Service submitted outline business plans for Checkpoint 2. The decisions are: Scenario A: CSS proceeds with medium to low issues as part of development plan South Yorkshire Staffordshire North West London Arden North Yorkshire and Humber Kent and Medway Merseyside Cheshire, Warrington and Wirral Norfolk and Waveney North East North and East London West Yorkshire Best West (Somerset, Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire) CSS South (Southampton, Hampshire, Portsmouth and Isle of Wight) Scenario B: CSS proceeds with issues that need more rapid management Greater East Midlands Greater Manchester Cumbria and Lancashire Birmingham and Black Country Essex South London Surrey and Sussex Central Southern (Bucks, Oxfordshire, Berkshire, Gloucestershire and Swindon) Hertfordshire Scenario C: CSS stops West Mercia Peninsula (Devon and Cornwall) NHS Communications and Engagement Service CSS development plans, and plans for those CSSs which have been stopped, are currently being drawn up to ensure high quality commissioning support continues to be made available to all clinical commissioning groups (CCGs). The development plans will be binding and if the milestones in the plan are not met the Board Authority will review its support for the CSS. While CSSs are hosted by the Board Authority, it will be responsible for the financial risk. In the case of those CSSs which will not proceed beyond Checkpoint 2, the next steps will be: West Mercia and Peninsula\u2013 Strategic health authority (SHA) clusters are working with local CCGs, primary care trust clusters and CSSs to develop plans. NHS Communications and Engagement Service \u2013 An alternative business model, which will be nationally coordinated in a similar way to the other \u2018at scale\u2019 commissioning support offers, is being developed. In all three cases, there will still be a significant need for locally-based staff to deliver support services to CCGs and the main impact will be to senior management arrangements and organisation shape rather than to the roles that are available to NHS staff.

      "content": "The Government is setting out its ten-year strategy for transforming the way patients get and use information about their health. The Power of Information sets out plans to give all patients easy and continuous access to their own health records by 2015. From next year people can choose the best care for themselves and their families using a new website that covers the NHS, community services and social care. The NHS Commissioning Board Authority is developing a programme of work to deliver key elements of the information strategy through NHS organisations. The vision set out in The Power of Information is that patients are in control of the information they need to improve their health and wellbeing and NHS information systems are designed to support clinicians and other front-line staff to deliver safe, high quality care to their patients. Key elements of the strategy include: A commitment that, by 2015, anyone in England will be able to access their GP health record online as well as book appointments with their GP or request repeat prescriptions online A longer-term commitment that all health and care records held by hospitals and other service providers will be made securely available to patients, enabling them to become much more involved and in control of their own healthcare A new national website will give people access to information about NHS, public health and social care services.

The recruitment of Wave 1 assessors for the desktop review elements of the clinical commissioning group (CCG) authorisation process by SHA clusters has begun. The assessors\u2019 role will be to ensure that the evidence submitted by CCGs is assessed transparently, consistently and fairly and assessors will receive training and accreditation before they start work. The Board Authority has also recently published a self certification information pack to help CCG applicants for authorisation self-certify their compliance on the application form. The pack is designed to help ensure that interim Accountable Officers and Chairs, as well as governing bodies more broadly, understand the intent of compliance with the statements in the application form. In addition, a financial governance tool has been published to help CCGs collect the evidence required for their application for authorisation and to put in place the financial governance arrangements required from 1 April 2013. The submission deadlines for applications for each wave have also been confirmed and these are: Wave 1 \u2013 2 July Wave 2 \u2013 3 September Wave 3 \u2013 1 October Wave 4 \u2013 1 November Clinical commissioning group authorisation: Draft guide for assessors undertaking desk top review Clinical commissioning group authorisation: Draft guide for applicants Self certification information pack Finance governance tool Share: Tweet",

This could mean lots of providers in the market place, what will this mean to our health community? How do we ensure we are improving quality and value for our population? Can we make \u2018consensual commissioning\u2019 a reality?

      "content": "Contents Welcome from Barbara Hakin New web tool signposts learning and development opportunities Initiative to help CCGs with commissioning support decisions CCG remuneration guidance Running costs allowances update Authorisation \u2018surgeries\u2019 for waves two and three Key elements of authorisation process put in place The Functions of Clinical Commissioning Groups published Next steps for communications and engagement services News in brief Welcome from Barbara Hakin I know those CCGs in Wave 1 will be only too aware that the date for applications for authorisation is now less than three weeks away, on Monday 2 July. This is a hugely exciting and intense period for us all and certainly feels as if we are stepping up yet another gear. We are continuing to publish as much information and provide as much support as we can, and as fast as we can, to help those preparing for authorisation. Our website provides currently available information and links, and this will continue to expand over the coming weeks as we update the resources on the pathfinder learning network and move it across to the Board Authority\u2019s website. I\u2019m pleased that today I\u2019m able to alert you to the newly-published learning and support tool, where you will find in one place the learning and development resources available for all proposed CCGs to access, according to development needs (see story below for details). Organised by the authorisation domains, it provides direct links through to support available from key national bodies, and the NHS Commissioning Board Authority\u2019s own products. While PCT and SHA clusters continue to support proposed CCGs to work though their tailored development plans, this new learning and support web tool identifies and brings together those existing areas of support that apply countrywide and will provide an ongoing focal point for future products. Another piece of good news, we are planning to publish Securing Excellence in Primary Care Commissioning \u2013 the new single operating model for primary care commissioning \u2013 in the coming week. This will be another important moment as the Board Authority sets out its plans for the new primary care commissioning system which will introduce greater consistency, help to tackle inequalities, improve service quality, increase efficiency, and provide a greater focus on health outcomes. I know you will be very interested to see the new approach which is the result of extensive joint working with the national primary care organisations, CCG leaders and other primary care colleagues. I know there has been some debate about the model constitution framework and I hope that we have now reached a position where everybody understands how to approach the work. As a model, the framework was designed to be comprehensive in order to support CCGs to make sure they cover the right areas, meet the legal requirements and don\u2019t have to seek out all the relevant parts of legislation. CCGs could then choose tailor it to meet their own needs. It is up to the member practices to decide how they wish to prepare their constitution, using the model framework as a starting point, and to determine their own sign-off arrangements. We believe it would be helpful for at least one member of each practice to understand the full constitution because it is an important agreement. We welcome and support the proposal that CCGs could, if they wish, develop a shorter document that identifies those elements of the constitution which are critical for all members (such as decision-making and communications arrangements) and delegate responsibility for other elements to their leaders and/or the governing body to work through on their behalf. I also recognise that a good relationship between CCGs and local medical committees is critical and we would encourage you to build this into your approach. We are also pleased to be publishing HR guidance for the appointment of senior managers who will undertake the accountable officer role (chief officers) and chief finance officers. Additionally we are publishing a further set of frequently asked questions (see \u2018remuneration guidance\u2019 story for details on both). These documents clarify the CCGs\u2019 clear sovereignty in these processes and in determining the pay, terms and conditions from April 2013. You will be aware though that for the accountable officer role, the CCG identifies whom they wish to see appointed but the NHS Commissioning Board (NHS CB) makes the appointment during authorisation. On this basis, most CCGs are asking their NHS CB regional director to identify a suitable assessor to be on any interview panel. The documents also describe how these designate appointments can be hosted by a PCT using their terms and conditions for the interim period to 1 April 2013. As always, if you have any questions, comments or feedback about the commissioning development programme, or you would like to be added to the mailing list to receive this bulletin directly, please email me at pathfinderlearningnetwork@nhs.net Dame Barbara Hakin National Director for Commissioning Development New web tool signposts learning and development opportunities A comprehensive, new CCG learning and support web tool has been published on the NHS Commissioning Board Authority\u2019s website. It provides access to the development resources that meet current learning needs and which every proposed CCG can expect to be able to access during 2012-13. It is designed to support CCGs as they prepare for authorisation, the clinical leadership of commissioning and their development beyond authorisation. The web tool is designed as an easy-to-use series of web pages organised according to the domains of authorisation. Its development has been informed over a number of months by work with proposed CCGs and national primary care organisations. It aims to draw together in one place the focused learning outcomes for 2012-13 and the key products identified to support these. As well as resources provided by the Board Authority and Department of Health, it links through to support available from key national bodies, including the NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement, the Royal College of General Practitioners, the NHS Leadership Academy and the NHS Alliance and National Association of Primary Care. It is designed to complement local opportunities which are supported by SHA and PCT clusters. In addition, the Self Assessment Diagnostic Tool for proposed CCGs (originally made available in July 2011) has been refreshed to align it with the authorisation process. This is also available through the learning and support web tool, along with links to: Developing as an \u2018informed customer\u2019 (see story below) Effectively engaging member practices Supporting aspirant foundation trusts. Access the learning and support tool . If you have any questions about additional development support available in your region, please contact: North: graham.atkinson@northwest.nhs.uk London: nigel.littlewood@london.nhs.uk Midlands and East: lynne.bowers@westmidlands.nhs.uk South: greg.simpson-horn@southcentral.nhs.uk If you have any questions or comments about the tool itself, please email ccgdevelopment@nhs.net Initiative to help CCGs with commissioning support decisions A new initiative has been set up to help CCGs with the decisions they need to make around commissioning support services (CSSs) to meet the requirements for authorisation. A series of practical activities is planned and will include: June/July 2012: Revised \u2018ready reckoner\u2019 tool to help CCGs calculate the costs and implications of how they will carry out their functions, how they will structure themselves, what additional external support they need. Guidance for CSSs on collaboration with local authorities, independent sector or voluntary sector suppliers. A quick guide for CCGs to procuring commissioning support. Regional CCG procurement of commissioning support master classes. Consultation with CCGs and non-NHS suppliers of commissioning support to explore: the potential procurement options; CCGs\u2019 preferences, e.g. through framework arrangements or other procurement vehicles, including collaborative procurements; the timescales; and what support CCGs might need during procurement of commissioning support. September/October 2012: Learning network for CCG leads on commissioning support. Regional and national \u2018market days\u2019 in which CCGs can meet a range of potential suppliers from the NHS, local authorities, commercial and voluntary sectors. The development is in response to a recent survey of CCGs which found that CCGs need more information about the range of commissioning support options available and how to procure the services they need in the longer term. According to an independent report commissioned by NHS Commissioning Board Authority in March 2012, 59% of CCGs want more information about the choice of commissioning support, and a further 64% want more advice about how to procure their support. * The full report of the independent customer survey with proposed CCGs and NHS commissioning support services (CSSs) has been published on the NHS Commissioning Board Authority\u2019s website. The findings show that over 90% of proposed CCGs are very or quite confident that the arrangements they are putting in place for commissioning support will allow them to achieve authorisation. Just over a half say they expect to source at least 50% of their commissioning support through NHS CSSs, with around a further quarter sourcing 30%-49%. The survey was conducted in March and April 2012 as part of the arrangements to support the second stage in the business review process for CSSs, known as Checkpoint 2. CCG remuneration guidance Remuneration guidance and a set of frequently-asked-questions (FAQs) about the roles of chief officer and chief finance officer in a CCG have been published by the NHS Commissioning Board Authority. \u2018Chief officer\u2019 is the term used to describe the most senior manager in a CCG when this individual also takes the role of accountable officer. The Health and Social Care Act 2012 makes clear that a CCG when established may appoint employees as it considers appropriate, and is able to pay its employees and employ them on terms and conditions in accordance with the determinations of its governing body. CCGs are being strongly encouraged to follow the guidance, which has been approved by Remuneration and Terms of Service Committee at the Board Authority, to ensure that there is consistency and transparency in the use of public money and that the principles set out in the Will Hutton Fair Pay Review are applied. The guidance offers flexibility for CCGs to reflect local circumstances and the shape and nature of individual organisations. As with the Clinical commissioning groups HR guide , published in April 2012, it is intended to support CCGs to recruit, retain and motivate high calibre staff, while at the same time helping to minimise redundancies. The guidance, which will apply from the point CCGs become employing bodies on 1 April 2013, covers: proposed pay rates, joint management arrangements, development pay, recruitment and retention premiums, additional payments for additional responsibilities or complexity factors, the role of CCG remuneration committees, and reporting arrangements. It outlines three bands of payment for both chief officers and chief finance officers, based on the population sizes of CCGs. It also highlights that legislative regulations are likely to require CCGs to make publicly available annually information on the salaries, fees, pensions, travelling and other allowances and gratuities paid to senior managers and governing body members. Prior to establishment, the designate chief officer and chief finance officer will be \u2018assigned\u2019 to the CCG by their current employing organisation on their current terms and conditions. Any changes made by the PCT to the salaries of the designate chief officer and chief finance officer during this period will be subject to the general principles governing remuneration of staff employed by PCTs. The guidance is not intended as the basis of remuneration for accountable officers where being a clinician has been deemed an essential requirement. Guidance on the reimbursement of clinicians is included in Clinical commissioning groups governing body members: Role outlines, attributes and skills and further detail is provided in the FAQs. The remuneration guidance and frequently-asked questions are available on the Board Authority\u2019s website. Running costs allowances update A briefing on CCGs\u2019 running costs allowances has been published on the NHS Commissioning Board Authority\u2019s website. The briefing outlines how running costs allowances have been calculated on the basis of \u2018raw\u2019 population without weighting according to the traditional determinants of population need, such as age, sex or deprivation. The population data being used in the calculations is the latest Office of National Statistics\u2019 (ONS) projections for 2013 which is for a total England population of 53.56m. In contrast to this, the attribution data set (ADS), which is the source of GP list data, gives a patient population of 55.26m for practices in England in April 2011. The starting point for the calculation of running costs is the patient populations for a CCG\u2019s GP practices, as recorded in the ADS. This ensures that the distribution of running costs takes account of cross-boundary patient flows. These patient populations are then adjusted, using the pre-existing methodology used in PCT financial allocations, so that they match the total ONS England population projection of 53.56m. This is done by matching the total ADS population resident in each district local authority area to the ONS projection for 2013 (after excluding estimated counts of military personnel). The methodology takes account of factors such as: inaccurate lists, for instance where patients no longer live in the area and are registered with a different practice, but have not yet been removed from their previous GP\u2019s list; and unregistered people, who are included in ONS counts but are not on GPs\u2019 lists. Overall, running costs allowances have been set at a level which is consistent with the requirement to reduce NHS system wide administration costs by one third. Authorisation \u2018surgeries\u2019 for waves two and three The authorisation \u2018surgeries\u2019 for waves two and three will be held on: Wednesday 20 June \u2013 London Tuesday 26 June \u2013 Birmingham Thursday 28 June \u2013 Leeds Wednesday 4 July \u2013 London. CCGs have already been notified of these dates and venues will be confirmed soon. Each CCG has four places and people should register for places at the workshop of their choice by emailing Joanne Crosby ( joanne.crosby@northwest.nhs.uk ). The purpose of the surgeries is to help CCGs prepare their applications and hear more details about both the desktop assessment and site visit by the panel assessors. Details of workshops for wave 4 applicants will be released in due course. Key elements of authorisation process put in place The NHS Commissioning Board Authority has published Clinical commissioning group authorisation: Draft guide for assessors undertaking desk top review. It is an accompaniment to Clinical commissioning group authorisation: Draft guide for applicants and covers: The overarching principles, approach and methodology of the assessment process The key stages of assessment, and the requisite outputs of each stage; The published domain definitions, criteria and authorisation thresholds as set out in the applicants\u2019 guide and how to assess CCG evidence submissions against them. The recruitment of Wave 1 assessors with the right skills and competencies for the desktop review elements of the CCG authorisation process by the SHA clusters has taken place. The assessors\u2019 role will be to ensure that the evidence submitted by CCGs is assessed transparently, consistently and fairly and assessors will receive training and accreditation before they start work. The recruitment of panel assessors will begin shortly. A letter and user guide about the new CCG Authorisation Portal will be sent to all CCGs on 15 June 2012 outlining that the new, password-protected website will be available for use by Wave 1 CCG applicants from 18 June 2012 and for all other CCGs from 9 July 2012. Following this letter, each wave one \u2018super user\u2019 will receive an email directly from the service provider, GPTeamNet, giving log-in details for the CCG, including passwords. The same process will be followed for \u2018super users\u2019 for other waves in due course. The secure authorisation portal is designed to facilitate the submission process for CCGs, from evidence upload to the submission of the application, and a helpdesk will be provided. The Board Authority has also recently published a self certification information pack to help CCG applicants for authorisation self-certify their compliance on the application form. The pack is designed to help ensure that interim accountable officers and chairs, as well as governing bodies more broadly, understand the intent of compliance with the statements in the application form. In addition, a financial governance tool has also now been made available to provide support for proposed CCGs on the arrangements they will need to put in place for good financial governance and on the evidence they will need to present as part of their CCG\u2019s application for authorisation. For each main element of financial governance, the tool suggests the characteristics of good financial governance that the NHS Commissioning Board would expect CCGs to be able to demonstrate, both at the point of their application for authorisation and prior to 1 April 2013. The submission deadlines for applications for each wave have been confirmed and these are: Wave 1 \u2013 2 July Wave 2 \u2013 3 September Wave 3 \u2013 1 October Wave 4 \u2013 1 November. All the authorisation documents are available on the Board Authority\u2019s website. The Functions of Clinical Commissioning Groups published An updated guide to the functions of CCGs has been published to reflect the final content of the Health and Social Care Act 2012. The Functions of Clinical Commissioning Groups sets out: The key statutory duties of CCGs \u2013 the \u2018must dos\u2019 The key statutory powers \u2013 the things that CCGs have the freedom to do, if they wish, to help meet these duties. The guide is not intended to be a substitute for the Act but to act as a helpful summary to which busy GPs and proposed CCGs can refer when planning for and implementing their responsibilities. The new document provides an update to The Functions of GP Commissioning Consortia: A Working Document which was published in March 2011. The guide has been published on the Department of Health\u2019s website . Next steps for communications and engagement services Next steps have been agreed which will ensure the development of a revised operating model for communications and engagement services in line with the timescales for the commissioning support business review and assurance process. A \u2018hub and spoke\u2019 model \u2013 similar to that of the other \u2018at scale\u2019 CSSs \u2013 will be developed which links all CSSs and CCGs across England, maps onto local engagement services, ensures staff are based appropriately in relation to local communities, and concentrates at scale work and additional communications expertise in a small number of hubs. It is envisaged the model will incorporate local delivery teams and \u2018at scale\u2019 services delivered to a set of professional and measurable service standards through the commissioning support community. The work will take place during June and July and a final decision will be made by the NHS Commissioning Board Authority in late July, ahead of the Checkpoint 3 process. News in brief The NHS Commissioning Board Authority has approved the principles of the design of the local area teams as outlined in the last CCG bulletin and determined that there will be 27 teams working from a number of office bases across their geographical area. The detailed shape, geography and responsibilities for these teams will be available shortly.

      "content": "With all of the hype surrounding the recent Jubilee celebrations it would be almost possible to forget that we are on the edge of an economic precipice in Europe at present. The joy of smiley painted faces, vigorously waving flags and the Great British stiff upper lip in all weathers seemed to replace fears of fading economies, empty bank vaults and European not so bonhomie. But at FDG this week all this was blown away as EU themes took centre stage. The recurrent theme of this week\u2019s meeting was system leadership. How does the NHS move away from the old centralised authority (Department of Health) to one where the new central authority (NHSCB) has a subsidiary function, performing only those tasks which cannot be performed effectively at a more immediate or local level? On the one hand it seems to be what everyone has been asking for, \u201cNo more top down targets..\u201d, but on the other it would seem there is a danger of the question morphing into,\u201d\u2026.so what do we do next?\u201d. Somehow being liberated suddenly doesn\u2019t feel so liberating. My initial instinct was that whilst there seems to be a genuine intellectual acceptance within NHSCB of the required change, it makes turning round an oil super tanker look like ice dancing. However, as the discussion progressed it was clear that with the central authority gone some parts of the NHS might feel like they were being asked to ice dance on water! Curiously, I found myself empathising with the central authority I had so long felt held captive by. Was this the NHS version of Stockholm Syndrome? Was I witnessing the central authority deep in self-reflective group therapy? How was the NHS going to respond to such a diagnosis? You might be surprised to hear that as a GP I had absolutely no idea how to manage Stockholm Syndrome, perhaps I missed National Stockholm Syndrome Week. So, I responded like any GP would and googled for a self-help guide on managing Stockholm Syndrome. Whilst I could not honestly profess to have found a wealth of evidence-based information on it, there do seem to be some interventions that might also be applicable to victims within the NHS: Helping victims to recognise which of the behaviours shown to them are acceptable, remember last month\u2019s \u201cJack Welch conundrum\u201d? Self-help groups to deal with feelings of isolation Developing alternative sources of care and nurturing Acknowledging the presence of the conflicting behaviours of abuser and supporter in the one authority All of which are currently available on the NHS in one form or another without having to go and see your GP for a referral. The final problem up for discussion was The European Union Cross-Border Healthcare Directive. In a nutshell, this means home states paying for treatments their citizens receive in the EU, if they would have been provided under their home healthcare system, and each member state being required to inform and assist their residents in making use of these arrangements. EU member states are required to adopt this directive by 25th October 2013, at the latest. You don\u2019t need me to tell you what problems could be associated with this, or do you? The solutions seemed to come straight from the Stockholm Syndrome treatment manual. The NHSCB could just take over the whole issue but simply directing everyone else was not consistent with the behaviours now expected from it. Sharing an understanding of the problem with CCGs, who could also call on support from other agencies, was likely to result in CCGs feeling less isolated and more likely to acknowledge the value of the co-existing conflicted behaviours required from the NHSCB. All resulting in common intention rather than central direction. Simples \u2026!? Share: Tweet",

      "title": "Single Operating Model for Commissioning Primary Care | NHS England",
      "content": "The NHS Commissioning Board Authority has published the single operating model for the commissioning of primary care services within the NHS. The new system will come into effect from 1 April 2013. At this date, the NHS Commissioning Board will take on many of the current functions of PCTs with regard to the commissioning of primary care health services, as well as some nationally-based functions currently undertaken by the Department of Health. Securing excellence in commissioning primary care describes the system by which the NHS Commissioning Board will use the \u00a312.6bn the NHS spends on commissioning primary care to secure the best possible outcomes for patients. In time, through this new system, the NHSCB will also develop the future strategy for primary care. The benefits the Board Authority hopes to achieve from this change are: Greater consistency and fairness in access and provision for patients, with an end to unjustifiable variations in services and a reduction in health inequalities Better health outcomes for patients as primary care clinicians are empowered to focus on delivering high quality, clinically-effective, evidence-based services Greater efficiencies in the delivery of primary care health services through the introduction of standardised frameworks and operating procedures. It is a system change which will have an impact on patients, providers and their teams, and commissioners, and the Board Authority has systematically taken 18 months to research, develop and consult upon the proposals to ensure they are practical and workable. It has worked closely with current commissioners, patient representatives, PCT medical directors, dental, pharmaceutical and optometric advisors, and key national, regional and local stakeholder and professional bodies to seek to understand and preserve the best of the current system, learn from good practice, and ensure that the system changes will be managed effectively. The document is based on three guiding principles: People should have access to continuously improving, high quality primary care provision regardless of where they live The commissioning system should be clinically led and professionally managed to balance the needs of local communities within a single operating system There should be consistency in the contractual relationship between providers and the NHS Commissioning Board as the commissioner. Over the next few months, local area teams, which will be responsible for the delivery of the new system, will be appointed as will central and regional primary care commissioning teams. CCGs, commissioning support services and local authorities will start to assume their future roles and responsibilities. This document will provide a guide these teams and bodies as they establish and/or further develop their organisations.

      "content": "The circus was in town for the Future Design Group today! No \u2026 we are not there every week \u2026 there was a Big Top up just across the road from Quarry House. Actually, I am not sure whether it was housing a circus or not. For all I know it could have been the temporary HQ for Public Health England, perhaps symbolic of its itinerant nature. Or, perhaps a test event for all those government meetings that will not be taking place in London during the Olympics. Maybe it is going to host one of those \u201ccircus skills team-building exercises\u201d events to support the Local Area Teams in building relationships with CCGs; teaching traditional skills such as lion taming, fire eating, strongman\u2026\u2026.I digress. At one low point in the meeting ambition seemed to be distinctly lacking as \u201cimprovement\u201d was at risk of being demoted to \u201cnot getting any worse\u201d. Travel and meeting arrangements during the London 2012 Olympics briefly threatened to become the next \u201cMillennium Bug\u201d. The \u201cMatrix\u201d was relegated from a major blockbuster to a major headache in trying to set up a new organisational structure in such a short period of time. The Ricardo brothers were high on the trapeze \u2026 I was being distracted by that circus again! But, in the middle of it all, there was a searching debate about what you actually replace \u2018top down targets\u2019 with? Could you just call them something else? Were some of them actually quite valuable? Surely measuring improvement involves measuring something? How many indicators were there going to be in the government\u2019s mandate to the NHS CB, and how many would have to be passed on to CCGs? How about agreeing a common outcome like \u2026 an increase in life years, and agreeing with each CCG a local plan to increase life years for their population? The ambition was returning! But what if it took several years to demonstrate that improvement? What indicators could you use to demonstrate progress along the way? What if one set of investments in the short-term delivered better value over a 2 year period, but a different set of investments in a longer-term plan would eventually reap an exponentially higher and more sustainable reward in comparison by the end of a 10 year period? Lots of questions with few clear answers; by the end some of us were in serious need of an analyst. This left me wondering how these questions were to be answered. The dangers of paralysis by analysis had been debated at FDG only a few weeks ago, so work is already underway to better understand how to maximise the value of any analytical function within NHS CB. The Stockholm Syndrome management plan advises that the answer is not just determined by the central authority but by all relevant parties. Shared decision making requires new behaviours in all parties and a need to demonstrate these behaviours rather than simply talking about how any of us is going to behave. We are all going to need some sensitively executed external reference points along the way to minimise the dangers of further collusion. From a commissioning perspective, truly shared decision making between NHS CB and CCGs will require the leadership at both a national and local level to be closely connected. An effective working relationship between CCGs and Local Area Teams will be a critical success factor. Sounds like we might need to keep the Big Top up for those \u201ccircus skills team-building exercises\u201d after all; although perhaps focusing more on balancing, plate spinning, juggling \u2026 I wonder if CCGs will be allowed in the tent?

The aim of the Framework is to help commissioners understand when competition could be used as an effective way to help achieve the best outcomes for patients. The Framework aims to support the requirement of commissioners as set out in the Health and Social Care Act 2012 to ensure good practice and to promote and protect patient choice. Competition is one of the many tools that commissioners may decide to use to improve services for patients. The content of the Framework will evolve as part of on-going discussion with commissioners to understand what tools they would find most useful. The Framework will be an easy to access suite of inter-related online products, including guidance, interactive tools, case studies and latest news that will be developed under the guidance of commissioners. Get involved The NHS CBA and Monitor are at the NHS Confederation annual conference and exhibition on stands D32 and C12 respectively. Keith Holden from the NHS CBA and Amy Cauldwell-Nichols from Monitor will be holding an eXhibition eXchange session on the Framework and answering questions at the NHS CBA stand (D32) on Thursday 21 June 2012 between 1.10pm and 2.10pm .

The recruitment of Wave 1 assessors for the desktop review elements of the clinical commissioning group (CCG) authorisation process by SHA clusters has begun. The assessors\u2019 role will be to ensure that the evidence submitted by CCGs is assessed transparently, consistently and fairly and assessors will receive training and accreditation before they start work. The Board Authority has also recently published a self certification information pack to help CCG applicants for authorisation self-certify their compliance on the application form. The pack is designed to help ensure that interim Accountable Officers and Chairs, as well as governing bodies more broadly, understand the intent of compliance with the statements in the application form. In addition, a financial governance tool has been published to help CCGs collect the evidence required for their application for authorisation and to put in place the financial governance arrangements required from 1 April 2013.

      "content": "The NHS Commissioning Board Authority has published the single operating model for the commissioning of primary care services within the NHS. The new system will come into effect from 1 April 2013. At this date, the NHS Commissioning Board will take on many of the current functions of PCTs with regard to the commissioning of primary care health services, as well as some nationally-based functions currently undertaken by the Department of Health. Securing excellence in commissioning primary care describes the system by which the NHS Commissioning Board will use the \u00a312.6bn the NHS spends on commissioning primary care to secure the best possible outcomes for patients. In time, through this new system, the NHSCB will also develop the future strategy for primary care. The benefits the Board Authority hopes to achieve from this change are: Greater consistency and fairness in access and provision for patients, with an end to unjustifiable variations in services and a reduction in health inequalities Better health outcomes for patients as primary care clinicians are empowered to focus on delivering high quality, clinically-effective, evidence-based services Greater efficiencies in the delivery of primary care health services through the introduction of standardised frameworks and operating procedures. It is a system change which will have an impact on patients, providers and their teams, and commissioners, and the Board Authority has systematically taken 18 months to research, develop and consult upon the proposals to ensure they are practical and workable. It has worked closely with current commissioners, patient representatives, PCT medical directors, dental, pharmaceutical and optometric advisors, and key national, regional and local stakeholder and professional bodies to seek to understand and preserve the best of the current system, learn from good practice, and ensure that the system changes will be managed effectively. The document is based on three guiding principles: People should have access to continuously improving, high quality primary care provision regardless of where they live The commissioning system should be clinically led and professionally managed to balance the needs of local communities within a single operating system There should be consistency in the contractual relationship between providers and the NHS Commissioning Board as the commissioner. Over the next few months, local area teams, which will be responsible for the delivery of the new system, will be appointed as will central and regional primary care commissioning teams. CCGs, commissioning support services and local authorities will start to assume their future roles and responsibilities. This document will provide a guide these teams and bodies as they establish and/or further develop their organisations.

      "content": "The NHS Commissioning Board Authority has today confirmed receipt of 35 applications for authorisation from the CCGs in \u2018wave one\u2019 in accordance with its deadline of 2 July 2012. Wave one is the first of four waves of applications from CCGs which are to be submitted from July to November 2012. Dame Barbara Hakin, National Director for Commissioning Development at the Board Authority, said: \u201cI am delighted that the CCG authorisation process is beginning on schedule and that we have received all 35 applications in full from the CCGs in wave one. I wish to thank CCGs for their energy and commitment; all CCGs are working incredibly hard to set themselves up as effective and safe health commissioning organisations by April 2013 and it is inspiring to see the process get off to a good start. \u201cI want to emphasise strongly that all the authorisation waves are equal and there is no difference between a CCG in wave one or wave four in terms of competence. Proposed CCGs in each wave will continue to develop throughout the year as they take on increasing responsibilities, and could have conditions set irrespective of the wave in which they are placed.\u201d CCGs are new, clinically-led organisations coming into being for the first time and the NHS Commissioning Board is responsible for supporting the development of CCGs as they move through authorisation. For this reason, the thresholds for authorisation reflect the current stage of CCG development, and are set in the context of the longer-term vision. Alongside the responsibility to provide support, the NHS Commissioning Board has a parallel duty to assure that CCGs are able to commission safely, use their budgets responsibly, and exercise their functions to improve quality, reduce inequality and deliver improved outcomes within the available resources. The outcome of wave one is due to be considered by the NHS Commissioning Board in October 2012. The application for authorisation comprises an application form on which the CCG must self-certify its compliance in a number of areas and up to 19 core evidence documents. In addition the CCG may choose to submit other documents. The full list of authorisation waves is available here. Comments on this page are now closed. Share: Tweet",

      "content": "Health Secretary Andrew Lansley today set out new care objectives for the improvement of health and healthcare, with the publication of a draft mandate \u2013 Our NHS care objectives: a draft mandate to the NHS Commissioning Board \u2013 which sets out the expectations for the health service and marks the move to a more patient centred, independent, transparent and outcomes focused NHS. Professor Malcolm Grant, Chair of the NHS Commissioning Board Authority said: \u201cFor the first time the Government is setting out for public consultation, in this single statement, the improvements in health outcomes for the people of England that it expects the NHS to deliver in the coming years. In focusing explicitly on outcomes \u2013 such as reductions in premature deaths, and improving the experience of patients \u2013 rather than on processes and operational targets, it kicks off a fresh approach that has the potential to truly liberate the NHS. The idea is to give clinical leaders the freedom to innovate rather than tying them to centrally determined processes and subjecting them to detailed day to day political control. \u201cHence the Department of Health\u2019s consultation on the mandate provides an important opportunity for all those who share this determination to focus on real improvements in health outcomes to influence the way the future NHS operates in order to bring this about. \u201cI am convinced that the best way to do this is to keep the mandate focused on improving overall outcomes for patients, rather than clogging it up with a range of narrowly conceived targets. That would work in the opposite direction by stifling the very freedom and innovation that is essential for clinically-led future change that puts the patient at the centre of the system. \u201cThat is the fundamental test against which we will be assessing the draft mandate, and we would encourage others to do the same.\u201d The government is now seeking public feedback on the draft care objectives www.mandate.dh.gov.uk . The consultation period will run from 4 July to 26 September. Responses will help to inform the final care objectives, which will be published in Autumn 2012, before they officially come into force in April 2013. Comments on this page are now closed.

It seems each time I write to you that we\u2019ve reached another important milestone on the road to the new clinical commissioning system \u2013 and this time is no different. I am very aware of the vast amount of hard work and incredible progress that all proposed CCGs have made in the last few months and today we hit the day for the first wave of proposed CCGs to submit their applications for authorisation. The information the NHS Commissioning Board receives, together with the feedback from the site visits, will inform the authorisation decision, so I understand that these are demanding times for you \u2013 especially as you\u2019re having to do all this alongside the day job of continuing to make sure your patients receive the best possible care. We will of course be using the wave 1 process to feed into and inform subsequent waves so we can share the learning across the country. You may already be aware that the secondary regulations referring to CCGs were laid in Parliament last week and contain very specific information on the membership, names, establishment and governance of CCGs. I know that many of you have been waiting for confirmation of this, particularly on the composition of governing bodies. The regulations are clear that while local councillors are disqualified from being on a CCG governing body, employees of a Local Authority may be members. However, a LA employee may not fulfil the role of lay member. Equally, while the prescribed registered nurse may not be from general practice, each CCG has the right to choose additional governing body members from any practice \u2013 including practice nurses. Indeed, whilst the makeup of the governing body must include a position for the four members described in regulations (two lay members, a nurse and a secondary care specialist), the membership practices can otherwise choose who sits on it (in line with the regulations). I believe this does give you the freedom to create your governing body to ensure it represents the wide range of clinical experience needed to make the right decisions for your populations. I know how much some of you are struggling to find a secondary care specialist from a provider where there is no conflict of interest. We are working with the medical colleges to help with this. Many areas are recruiting retired consultants. As we move closer towards April 2013 we are also continuing to share a whole host of supporting information to help you as emerging CCGs. We have recently published the new single operating model for primary care commissioning. Securing excellence in commissioning primary care sets out the NHS Commissioning Board Authority\u2019s plans for the new primary care commissioning system which will introduce greater consistency, help to tackle inequalities and improve service quality amongst other things. Find out more in the bulletin below. A number of other guidance and framework documents have also been released in the last few days and these are also highlighted in the bulletin. I would particularly like to draw your attention to the employment status guidance for GPs which has been drawn up by the accountants RMS Tenon and is extremely helpful for clinicians and CCG managers. It does help clarify some of the personal financial implications of GPs taking on roles in CCGs, so I urge you to familiarise yourselves with it. Some news from here at the Board Authority that I wanted to share with you. Three of the four directors in the Commissioning Development directorate have been appointed now. Rosamond Roughton will lead on the translation of the NHS CB strategy into the development of the commissioning system, and the running of the directorate; John Bewick will provide overall leadership of the development of CCGs, and the framework for improving the effectiveness of CCGs; and Ben Dyson will lead on the design of commissioning enablers, including standard contracts and the strategy for incentives for CCGs. Ben will also be the lead director for the development of strategies for primary care within the NHS CB. Meanwhile, our Director of Commissioning Support, Joe Rafferty, will be leaving us at the end of August to take up his new post as chief executive of Mersey Care Trust and we will be strengthening the team, working under the direction of Richard Jeavons, to support this work. Finally, it was wonderful to have a chance to see and speak to so many of you at the NHS Confederation conference and the Commissioning 2012 show in the last couple of weeks. The Board Authority\u2019s stand at both events was extremely busy with delegates, colleagues and speakers taking the opportunity to network and ask questions and I hope you found the shows and the sessions useful. As always, if you have any other questions, comments or feedback about the commissioning development programme, or you would like to be added to the mailing list to receive this bulletin directly, please do email me at pathfinderlearningnetwork@nhs.net . Dame Barbara Hakin National Director for Commissioning Development Single Operating Model for commissioning primary care The NHS Commissioning Board Authority has published the single operating model for the commissioning of primary care services within the NHS. Securing excellence in commissioning primary care describes the system by which the NHS Commissioning Board will use the \u00a312.6bn the NHS spends on commissioning primary care to secure the best possible outcomes for patients. In time, through this new system, the NHSCB will also develop the future strategy for primary care. The new system will come into effect from 1 April 2013. At this date, the NHS Commissioning Board will take on many of the current functions of PCTs relating to the commissioning of primary care health services, as well as some nationally-based functions currently undertaken by the Department of Health.

It is a system change which will have an impact on patients, commissioners, providers and their teams and the Board Authority has systematically taken 18 months to research, develop and consult upon the proposals to ensure they are practical and workable. It has worked closely with a range of stakeholders to understand and preserve the best of the current system, learn from good practice, and ensure that the system changes will be managed effectively. Over the next few months, local area teams, which will be responsible for the delivery of the new system, will be appointed as will central and regional primary care commissioning teams. Meanwhile CCGs, commissioning support services and local authorities will start to assume their future roles and responsibilities. This document will provide a guide these teams and bodies as they establish and/or further develop their organisations. To read the document and supporting information visit the NHS Commissioning Board Authority website . NHS (Clinical Commissioning Groups) Regulations 2012 The Health and Social Care Act 2012 sets out the high-level framework for the establishment of CCGs, and provides for regulations to set out more specific provisions. The National Health Service (Clinical Commissioning Groups) Regulations 2012 were laid in Parliament on 26 June and make provision for the membership, names, establishment and governance of CCGs. Specifically, the regulations cover: which providers of primary medical services must be members of a CCG; naming requirements for CCGs; the process for: applications for establishment as a CCG (i.e. authorisation); establishment subject to conditions; applications from CCGs to vary their constitutions, to merge with other CCGs, and to dissolve. CCG governance, covering: the membership of the governing body; the qualification, appointment, tenure etc. of members of the governing body; the qualification, appointment, tenure etc. of chairs of the governing body and its statutory committees; and information on remuneration to be published by the governing body. The regulations are due to come into force on 1 October 2012. Much of the substance of the regulations is based on the NHS CBA\u2019s publications for CCGs on establishment, governance and authorisation which were co-produced with the NHS. Two areas that may attract attention are: local councillors are disqualified from being on a CCG governing body, although employees of a Local Authority may be members (but not lay members). The Department of Health\u2019s view is that it is more appropriate for local councillors to be members of the Health and Wellbeing Board. the requirement that the prescribed registered nurse and secondary care doctor on a CCG governing body may not be employed by a provider from which the CCG commissions services, or in the case of the nurse by a general practice. There are two exceptions to this: it would not include providers, where individual patients exercise their right to choose a provider in another part of the country, or in circumstances where an individual patient needs a relatively specialised service that might have to be provided by a provider with which the CCG would not usually contract. The requirement is to reflect the commitment in the Government response to the NHS Future Forum report that the nurse and secondary care doctor should not have a conflict of interest. Code of conduct published A draft code of conduct has been published this week setting out additional safeguards that CCGs are advised to use when commissioning services for which GP practices could be potential providers. The Health and Social Care Act places a duty on the NHS Commissioning Board to publish guidance for CCGs on managing conflicts and a duty on CCGs to have regard to such guidance. The Act also requires that CCGs set out in their constitution their proposed arrangements for managing conflicts of interest. The document Towards establishment: Creating responsive and accountable CCGs , which we published in February, sets out general safeguards that CCGs should have in place to manage conflicts of interest, including: arrangements for declaring interests maintaining a register of interests excluding individuals from decision-making where a conflict arises engagement with a range of potential providers on service design. Since then, we have worked with emerging CCGs, national primary care organisations, the Competition and Cooperation Panel and other stakeholders to develop this draft Code of Conduct to provide more specific, additional safeguards where CCGs are commissioning services that could potentially be provided by GP practices. The Code is being published to support CCGs in further developing their governance arrangements and to allow wider engagement on the proposals, which the Board can take into account in publishing statutory guidance later in the year. The Code sets out: additional factors that CCGs should address when drawing up plans for services that might be provided by GP practices steps that CCGs should take to assure others that these services are appropriately commissioned from GP practices recommended procedures for decision-making in cases where majority of GPs (or other practice representatives) on decision-making group have potential interest transparent arrangements for publishing details of payments to GP practices potential role of commissioning support services the role of NHS Commissioning Board in supporting CCGs and providing assurance Commissioning assembly Sir David Nicholson and the CCG Design Group have written to emerging CCG leaders this week to invite one senior clinical lead from each CCG to join a new Commissioning Assembly. The letter can be seen here . The new clinical commissioning system\u2019s success in improving outcomes for patients will be determined to a large extent by the relationships which are formed between CCGs and the NHS Commissioning Board (NHS CB) both at national and local level. The executive team and a group of CCG leaders (the Design Group) have worked together to identify the key principles on which the relationship will depend and a proposal for how to take this collaboration forward. This thinking builds from the discussions at the December / January workshops for CCGs, and has been tested more widely in informal discussions with emerging CCGs leaders during visits across the country. The assembly will bring together leaders from all the CCGs and the NHS CB with the following purpose and roles: To create shared leadership at national level across all clinical commissioners, fostering the sense of \u201cone team\u201d with joint responsibility for ensuring that clinically-led commissioning develops and flourishes To be the infrastructure through which CCGs and the NHS CB can co-produce national strategy and direction To be the mechanism through which CCGs can build consensus and have a common voice on key issues To be a learning network through which leaders of NHS Commissioning Board and CCGs can develop commissioning to be the best it can be To facilitate communication between leaders of the clinical commissioning system at a national level A shared work programme is also being suggested with CCG leaders coming together in smaller groups to work collectively on areas of importance or interest. Further information on the assembly will be available later in the year. Draft mandate to the NHS Commissioning Board The government\u2019s consultation on the mandate Our NHS care objectives: a draft mandate to the NHS Commissioning Board has been published today and can now be found on the Department of Health\u2019s website . The draft mandate sets out 22 objectives for the delivery of NHS care by the NHS Commissioning Board. A public consultation is now taking place to enable all stakeholders to have their say on the improvements in health outcomes that the NHS will be expected to deliver in the coming years. The mandate focuses explicitly on outcomes \u2013 such as reductions in premature deaths, and improving the experience of patients \u2013 rather than on processes and operational targets. The idea is to give clinical leaders the freedom to innovate, essential for future change that puts the patient at the centre of the system. The consultation period will run until 26 September 2012. Recruitment of domain and key assessors for Wave 1 CCG authorisation Over 50 domain and key assessors have now been recruited to undertake the desktop review process for Wave 1 CCG authorisation. Assessors have been identified by the NHS Commissioning Board\u2019s Regional Directors and all come from senior roles in the NHS. The assessors\u2019 role will be to ensure that the evidence submitted by each CCG is assessed transparently, consistently and fairly. The assessors are now being trained so that they understand their role in the authorisation process and they will be allocated to CCGs in the next few days. The process of recruiting assessors for later waves and identifying panel members is now also well underway. Authorisation portal now open The portal for submission of application documentation is now open \u2013 as Wave 1 CCG applicants will already be aware. Proposed CCGs in waves 2, 3 and 4 will receive their log in details shortly, so please make sure you have sent the contact details of your named person to joanne.crosby@northwest.nhs.uk so we can get your details to you. CCGs should be aware of their deadlines for submission of documents, so we urge all applicants to upload their documentation as early as possible. Don\u2019t leave it until the last minute! And we will also be using the announcement stream on the portal home page to let you know about any practical advice and information and the dates of your site visits, so please keep an eye on that too. A reminder that support is available should you need it from support@gpteamnet.com or by calling 0191 201 2166. Commissioning support: Checkpoint 3: Guidance and financial template Detailed guidance and a financial model template have been released to commissioning support services as part of the preparations for \u2018Checkpoint 3\u2019 \u2013 the final stage of the business review and assurance process \u2013 which begins on 31 August 2012. The guidance outlines to CSSs what they will need to include in their full business plan and financial plan. Checkpoint 3 will take place in September and will comprehensively test the full business plan, strategy and overall feasibility of CSSs in order to ensure the NHS Commissioning Board Authority can make a decision as to whether the CSS has met the necessary criteria ahead of the hosting decision. The NHS Commissioning Board is due to consider the outcome of Checkpoint 3 in October 2012. An updated factsheet on commissioning support is on the Board Authority\u2019s website. Commissioning intelligence self-assessment tool (CISAT) Commissioners of clinical services have a number of key intelligence requirements, which need to be addressed in order to deliver great commissioning. CCGs will need accurate, relevant and timely information to enable them to design and plan services and ensure that they are open, responsive and transparent for patients, carers and members of the public. These information requirements are described in the Commissioning Intelligence Model (CIM) that was published by the NHS Commissioning Board Authority in January 2012. The CIM was produced with emerging CCGs to help in thinking through how best to develop these capabilities, and to support local discussions around their commissioning intelligence needs. A Commissioning Intelligence Self-Assessment Tool (CISAT) has also now been developed to help proposed CCGs: understand how commissioning intelligence can be used to improve outcomes identify any gaps in current provision and create a development plan to address these shortfalls identify the commissioning intelligence services that they may then wish to procure The model, the tool and further information about both can be seen on the NHS Commissioning Board Authority\u2019s website . Employment status guidance for GPs A document has been published by the accountants RMS Tenon which aims to clarify the financial implications of GPs taking on roles in CCGs. It is important to establish the correct employment status for any worker from the outset. Wrongly identifying a worker as self-employed when they should have been treated as employed could leave the engager facing large tax and National Insurance liabilities. Therefore, the employment status of individuals engaged for CCG posts should be carefully considered to ensure it is correct under current legislation. Technical Employment Status Guidance: Tax, National Insurance and Superannuation implications for GPs involved in Clinical Commissioning Group roles looks at each of these issues in turn and uses examples to help make things clear for both the GP and the CCG. The document can be downloaded here . Foundation trust toolkit In response to requests for guidance, provider and commissioning development teams have supported the development and road-testing of a toolkit which looks at the processes involved in becoming a foundation trust (FT) and how CCGs might work with local providers. If you have any queries about the FT \u2018pipeline\u2019 in your area, please contact the regional director of provider development at your SHA cluster: North of England: mike.shewan@northwest.nhs.uk Midlands and the East: dale.bywater@nhs.net London: hannah.farrar@london.nhs.uk South of England: gareth.cruddace@southcentral.nhs.uk Commissioning maternity services: a resource pack to support CCGs Maternity services are important to the public and the Government is committed to improving choice of place of birth, continuity of care and women\u2019s experience of care. Pregnancy offers a unique opportunity to engage women from all sections of society and having the right support through pregnancy and at the start of life is vital for improving life chances and tackling inequalities. This maternity resource pack sets out a framework for the commissioning of the discrete set of maternity services provided by acute trusts \u2013 essentially obstetric and midwifery care across the antenatal, intrapartum and immediate postnatal periods. However, it is clear that the pathway for women, babies and new families from pre-conception to the early years of life is a complex one with many interdependencies. The resource pack focuses on outcomes and brings together existing service specifications, benchmarking templates and other resources, enabling CCGs to spend more time having informed discussions with providers about service delivery and redesign and focusing on matters that will make the most difference to women and families, rather than on process or bureaucracy. The resource pack has been co-produced with the clinical commissioning community, taking into account national priorities with the flexibility to reflect local needs. We welcome your feedback which will be used to refresh and improve the resources contained in the pack as commissioning of maternity services by CCGs evolves. The pack can be downloaded from the CCG development section of the CCG resources page on the Board Authority\u2019s website. Developing the Commissioning Outcomes Framework: regional events The NHS Commissioning Board Authority is at a key stage in the development of the Commissioning Outcomes Framework (COF). The Framework will play an important role in driving up quality in the new system. Covering \u00a360billion of services commissioned by CCGs across the NHS it will translate the NHS Outcomes Framework information into clear, comparative data on the quality of services that clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) commission for their local populations and the outcomes achieved for patients. The Board Authority has asked NICE and the NHS Information Centre for Health and Social Care to develop proposals for comparative outcome measures for the Framework \u2013 these will be published at the beginning of August. The NHS CBA is looking to work with the CCGs and other stakeholders to develop the COF concept so that it becomes a valued way of driving up quality improvement. In collaboration with Commissioning Development leads, NICE and the Information Centre, the Board Authority is organising a series of regional workshops and engagement events in August and September. National stakeholder organisations, CCGs and patient groups involved in the development of COF are being invited. The events will be an opportunity to receive an update and for colleagues to help shape the COF for 2013/14. Event planning is underway. Further details on programmes and venues in each region will be available in July from Commissioning Development leads as follows: NHS North workshop event: Friday 10 August (Leeds) Jane Dunning Jane.Dunning@northwest.nhs.uk NHS South webinars in early September (dates to be confirmed) Greg Horn Greg.Horn@southcentral.nhs.uk NHS London workshop event: Evening of Monday 17 September Deborah Russell Deborah.Russell@london.nhs.uk NHS Midlands and East workshop event: Tuesday 18 September Jill Matthews jill.matthews1@nhs.net Public health guidance for CCGs Guidance has been released to help commissioners with local public health planning in the transition year before the new healthcare system goes live in April 2013. Guidance to support the provision of healthcare public advice to clinical commissioning groups has emerged from the White Paper consultation Health Lives, Healthy People: consultation on the funding and commissioning routes for public health where respondents raised the importance of ensuring public health advice remains central to NHS commissioning. This consequently led to Ministers giving a commitment that, subject to the Health and Social Care Bill, from 2013-14 CCGs would have access to public health advice, information and expertise in relation to the healthcare services that they commission, provided by local public health teams based in local authorities. The revised guidance (first issued in draft in February 2012) provides an explanation of how the healthcare public health advice service from local authorities to CCG commissioners will work. It will help CCGs and public health teams prepare for April 2013. The guidance was developed and informed by a task group consisting of representatives from local authorities, emerging CCGs, Directors of Public Health, the BMA, RCGP, ADASS and the Faculty of Public Health amongst others. It can be downloaded here . Choice and competition framework The NHS Commissioning Board Authority and Monitor are working on a joint project to develop a Choice and Competition Framework for the new NHS in England. Intended primarily for commissioners, the Framework aims to help users make sense of all of the rules, guidance and other features that make up how choice and competition should work in the new system. In particular, it aims to help commissioners decide how and when to use competition to best effect by making tools, case studies and other information readily available to them. To be of genuine value, the Framework needs to be developed with commissioners, so the joint NHS CBA-Monitor team are keen to involve CCGs in its development. A fact sheet with details of how to get involved can be seen here . Introducing the Calculating Quality Reporting Service (CQRS) The Quality Management and Analysis System (QMAS) \u2013 the system currently used to calculate payments to GPs under the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) \u2013 is going to be replaced by a new service called the Calculating Quality Reporting Service (CQRS). CQRS is being built with flexibility in mind and will therefore be able to do much more than QMAS. It is currently in development and will be in place to calculate payments for GP practices across England from the 2013/14 financial year. CQRS will report to the NHS Commissioning Board, CCGs and GP practices. It will calculate achievement and payments on quality services delivered by GP practices, including the QOF, nationally-commissioned enhanced services and services commissioned locally from GP practices that go beyond the scope of the GP contract. It will also calculate achievement by CCGs against the Commissioning Outcomes Framework (COF) and can calculate quality rewards for CCGs. QMAS will remain operational until the end of July 2013 to allow for end-of-year activities for the QOF for 2012/13. Existing data from QMAS will be migrated to CQRS, giving users on-going access to their QOF reports from previous years. Read more about CQRS and the wider context within which it will operate at www.connectingforhealth.nhs.uk/cqrs . Queries about CQRS should be emailed to cfh.cqrsfeedback@nhs.net . Share: Tweet",

      "content": "The NHS Commissioning Board Authority Chief Executive David Nicholson and a \u2018design group\u2019 of 15 CCG clinical leaders have written to emerging CCG leaders this week to invite one senior clinical lead from each CCG to join a new NHS Commissioning Assembly. The executive team at the Board Authority and the group of CCG leaders have worked together to identify the key principles on which the relationships between CCGs and the NHS Commissioning Board (NHSCB) will depend and a proposal for how to take this collaboration forward. The proposal builds on feedback from emerging CCG clinical leaders at workshops in December 2011 and January 2012, and has been tested more widely in informal discussions since. The group is also seeking views on a draft shared statement of intent and a draft framework for relationships for use as the basis for the development of relationships at a local and national level between CCGs and the NHSCB. The assembly will bring together leaders from all CCGs and the NHSCB with the following purpose and roles: To create shared leadership at national level across all clinical commissioners, fostering the sense of \u2018one team\u2019 with joint responsibility for ensuring that clinically-led commissioning develops and flourishes To be the infrastructure through which CCGs and the NHSCB can co-produce national strategy and direction To be the mechanism through which CCGs can build consensus and have a common voice on key issues To be a learning network through which leaders of NHSCB and CCGs can develop commissioning to be the best it can be To facilitate communication between leaders of the clinical commissioning system at a national level. A shared work programme is also being suggested with CCG leaders coming together in smaller groups to work collectively on areas of key importance including quality, financial strategy, incentives and primary care.

CCGs are the new clinically-led and patient-focused organisations who will be responsible for commissioning many of your local health services. Each CCG will be assessed by authorisation panels prior to being authorised to begin their new role. The Board Authority is now looking for people to become Lay Assessors to take part in the authorisation panel visits to proposed CCGs, alongside other panellists from the NHS and Local Authorities. The panels will assess each CCG\u2019s capability to deliver their new commissioning role. No formal qualifications are required, just a commitment to support the development of the new health system, an objective approach, a genuine interest in participation and an ability to constructively challenge the views and assumptions of senior/board level professionals. Lay Assessors are not expected to be experts in any specific field but are expected to bring their own experience and an independent view to the assessment . The role will require a commitment of approximately three to five days, plus training and development support to enable the assessors to carry out the role successfully. The Board Authority will also work with the Lay Assessors to learn from their experience and improve how it works collaboratively with patients and the public in the future. This will be a rolling programme over the next few months and so recruitment will begin on Monday 9 July and continue to Tuesday 31 July.

      "title": "The Matrix \u2013 Johnny Marshall | NHS England",
      "content": "A couple of months ago Sky News came to my surgery to interview me about CCGs. Whilst there, they took the opportunity to interview some patients about their views on the health reforms. One of my patients explained that they were very concerned about the ability of GPs to plan health services by holding the budgets, as they were not accountants. My initial internal reaction was the usual, \u201cbut GPs won\u2019t have to be accountants as they will work with healthcare managers, and other professionals, who have the skills they need to get the job done \u2026 blah \u2026 blah \u2026 blah \u2026\u201d. More recently, when I was reflecting on these comments ahead of a presentation I was giving, a new awareness began to dawn. From this patient\u2019s perspective the key skill that was needed in planning health services was one of accountancy. Is that really how commissioning in the NHS is perceived? Do people genuinely think that accountancy is a more valuable skill in planning health services than clinical know how? Is this just what they have come to expect? Is accountancy the defining NHS commissioning skill to date? In order to uphold the Trinity principle, \u201cif the answer is out there and it\u2019s looking for us, it will find us, if we want it to\u201d then we will first have to solve the Agent Brown dilemma \u2013 \u201cperhaps we are asking the wrong questions?\u201d. So it was timely during the review of the plans for the emerging directorate structure at FDG that discussion took place around how to put clinicians at the heart of the NHS CB. The challenge seems to be around coming up with an organisation design that enables operational delivery within the limited running costs, now that is a challenge that CCGs can relate to. In order to meet this challenge, as a Neo-Commissioning organisation, NHS CB cannot simply become a central machine that draws on the energy of clinicians. Somehow, it will need to embed them in its every activity, however hard a red pill that might be to swallow. The proposed solution is a directorate organisational design principle based on the \u201cmatrix\u201d, designed to integrate parallel universes. Essentially, it operates on the principle that directorates need to work together pooling their resources around a common purpose, which at face value sounds like a refreshing change from more traditional silo models of working. It gives the medical and nursing directorates a genuine opportunity to reach in to all parts of the organisation putting clinicians at the heart of the good ship Nebuchadnezzar. But, like any organisational structure, it is the attitudes and behaviours of the people operating within it that govern its success, just ask Mouse. If clinicians are to be influential within NHS CB then this will probably require them to resist acting as the Oracle, by simply holding a series of illuminating conversations with other directorates, and to engage in joint working and shared accountability around a common purpose. It would seem likely that the more accountability any directorate takes for delivery the more influence they will have on delivery. In the words of Agent Smith, \u201clisten \u2026 that is the sound of inevitability.\u201d However it is also clear that the boundaries of the matrix reach far beyond ship Nebuchadnezzar and that a multitude of organisations will need to join the Matrix to create the right environment for clinical commissioners to succeed, e.g. the Tarriff Trinity of CCGs, NHS CB and Monitor. At the end of the day it is likely, in the words of Morpheus, that, \u201cUnfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself\u201d. Welcome to the real world!

      "content": "Welcome from Dr Joe Rafferty Board Authority appoints first CSS managing directors and announces decision to host Business review and assurance update CSS \u2018externalisation\u2019 work gets underway HR update Communications and engagement services News in brief Welcome to the monthly Commissioning Support Bulletin from the NHS Commissioning Board Authority. I\u2019m very pleased to say that we have today announced the appointment of the first commissioning support service (CSS) managing directors. Many congratulations to the successful candidates \u2013 see item below for full details \u2013 most of whom are already in post. I wish to thank all the candidates for their extremely hard work in establishing their CSSs so far, and reassure those CSS teams which are yet to have a permanent leader appointed that we will support them over the coming months to stay on track. Further reassurance will also be provided by the Board Authority\u2019s decision to host all 23 CSSs through to the point in 2013-14 at which CCGs make their decisions on their choice of commissioning support, and complete their procurements. I am sure this will be welcome news to CSS staff and people in PCTs who wish to apply for jobs in CSSs. More details below. Later this week, we are planning to feed back the results of the \u2018at scale\u2019 tests, and I know some of you are waiting very keenly for these. The bids have been analysed and assessed and the decision-making process is due to be completed this week. We issued the Checkpoint 3 guidance, including the detailed financial guidance, on 29 June (see below for the full report). This provides detailed information and also some working assumptions which together are intended to guide CSSs as they prepare for the next stage of the assurance process. We have now turned our attentions to developing a guide to hosting which is likely to be ready in the autumn. Of course we will continue to discuss these potential arrangements with CSSs as we progress towards Checkpoint 3 so there is sufficient clarity for the preparation of full business plans. The hosting guide will provide more detailed information on the proposed hosting charge of between 25-50p per head of population \u2013 which will be levied by the NHS Commissioning Board from April 2013 \u2013 and the governance arrangements that will underpin CSS operations whilst hosted. We are also beginning to look at what further checks are required beyond checkpoint three so that, in totality, each CSS only has the right number of staff and overheads to match the contracts it has agreed with CCGs. We are currently developing proposals for: Checkpoint four in November, which will review CSS structures and their plans to \u2018right size\u2019 and \u2018right skill\u2019 Checkpoint five in January, which will review the contractual arrangements (including the terms and conditions) that CSS are putting in place with CCGs for 2013/14. More information on these will be published shortly. Meanwhile, it\u2019s important to highlight that we\u2019ve been working with local and national stakeholders from local government to reinforce the message that local authorities have a clear role to play alongside and, potentially, in partnership with other CSSs. The evidence that CSSs submitted for the second checkpoint demonstrated that some strong partnerships are emerging, with the majority of CSSs identifying local authorities as potential partners. Particularly strong partnership arrangements are beginning to emerge in several areas including North West London, Merseyside and the North East. In parallel, and on the back of queries from both CSSs and local government, we are also working with lawyers to create some simple guidance for the system around the rules and legal implications for CCGs and CSSs post April 2013 around collaborating with other organisations, including local authorities, the independent sector and the voluntary sector. We plan to release these later this month. As some of you may already know, I am fortunate to have been appointed to the role of chief executive of Mersey Care Trust in Liverpool and will take up the post from early September. I will be sorry to leave commissioning support and valued colleagues within the Board Authority and wider NHS at such an important time. Dame Barbara Hakin and Richard Jeavons are currently looking at future arrangements for the commissioning support team and we will update you shortly. Finally, I realise everyone is working very hard within an environment where there are still many unknowns. I wish to thank you all for your continued work and commitment on commissioning support. We are continuing to make good progress. Please keep in touch and let us know what you think. To send us your comments, or join our mailing list, please contact us at commissioningsupport@dh.gsi.gov.uk Dr Joe Rafferty Director of Commissioning Support Board Authority appoints first CSS managing directors and announces decision to host The first round of appointments to commissioning support service (CSS) managing director posts has been made by the NHS Commissioning Board Authority. Nine appointments have been made, while discussions are ongoing with others. The successful appointees, and their current CSSs, are: Robert Bacon \u2013 Birmingham, Black Country and Solihull Commissioning Support Service Stephen Childs \u2013 North East Commissioning Support Keith Douglas \u2013 Commissioning Support South Jan Hull \u2013 Best West Commissioning Support Derek Kitchen \u2013 Staffordshire Commissioning Support Service Rachel Pearce \u2013 Arden Commissioning Support Service Andrew Ridley \u2013 North Central and East London Commissioning Support Service Ming Tang \u2013 CSS to be confirmed Sarah Whiting \u2013 North West London Commissioning Support Service. At the same time, the Board Authority has announced that all 23 CSSs will now proceed to be hosted by the NHS Commissioning Board from October 2012; a shift in emphasis brought about as a result of Checkpoint 2, where the numbers of CSSs reduced to 23, and subsequent further evaluation which has made it clear that each is viable in terms of scale. In addition, the Board Authority recognises the need for stability for CSSs and their customers to ensure a successful transition to the new clinical commissioning system. This decision will also ensure: there is stability and continuity for CCGs as they prepare for and progress through the authorisation process, and as they carry out the procurement of their choice of commissioning support post-April 2013 the CSS development process is better aligned with the national HR transition process CSSs can ensure they are the \u2018right size\u2019 \u2013 a process of ensuring their income covers their costs \u2013 in time for April 2013. Clearly, no CSSs will now be stopped at Checkpoint 3, although this does not rule out further size variation or adjustment to management configurations as a result of the assurance process. Instead, building on the outcome of Checkpoint 2 \u2013 where all 23 were judged to be viable \u2013 the focus will be on making sure all CSSs are as good as they can be by April 2013. Where there are still gaps in leadership appointments, the Board Authority has said that immediate leadership arrangements will be put in place to ensure that all CCGs receive the support they need for authorisation and transition, and to ensure that all CSSs are capable of continuing to progress at pace. In some cases, existing interim managing directors will continue in post, while in others there will be new interim management arrangements. Dame Barbara Hakin, National Director of Commissioning Development, said: \u201cI\u2019m very pleased to announce the first CSS managing director appointments. Many congratulations to the nine successful candidates and their teams; it is a very positive step to see the first appointments to these important new units and enables us now to proceed at pace in putting the full senior management teams in place and, following that, the wider staffing structure. \u201cThese are significant new roles, requiring a very broad set of skills and competencies and it is absolutely essential for the future sustainability of CSSs that we get these appointments right. \u201cI\u2019m also pleased to be able to announce a period of greater stability and continuity both for CSSs and CCGs, and for NHS staff who wish to transfer into CSSs. \u201cOur key focus now is to ensure that CSS development continues at a rapid pace over the next few months as we continue the recruitment process. I am confident that CSSs will continue to provide a good service to CCGs over the coming months and that, very soon, we will be making further very high calibre appointments.\u201d The external recruitment search process has already begun and an advert for the roles was placed in HSJ last week. Potential candidates for these roles will find further information on the CSS Leaders website . The CSS finance director appointments process is expected to start shortly. As with the managing director roles, it is expected to have an internal phase and, if appropriate, an external phase. Business review and assurance update Detailed guidance and a financial model template have been sent to commissioning support services (CSSs) as part of the preparations for \u2018Checkpoint 3\u2019 \u2013 the next stage of the business review and assurance process \u2013 which begins in August 2012. The Checkpoint 3 guidance outlines to CSSs what they will need to include in their full business plan, while a separate financial planning guide and financial model template cover the financial requirements. CSSs will need to submit their full business plan, a financial model and a balanced scorecard by 31 August. CSSs have also been sent the dates of their Checkpoint 3 panel site visits. Checkpoint 3 will take place in September and CSSs will need to demonstrate they are commercially and financially viable and have completed their Checkpoint 2 development commitments. Key elements of the checkpoint will include: independent financial due diligence process, customer survey of CCGs, survey of CSS staff, and panel visits by the NHS Commissioning Board Authority. The NHS Commissioning Board is due to consider the outcome of Checkpoint 3 in October 2012 and, at that point, CSSs will be given a \u2018licence to operate\u2019 and an updated development plan. The licence to operate will describe the rules, processes and policies that will underpin the operational arrangements of CSSs during the hosted period \u2013 it will be provisional from October and more formal from April 2013. More information on this will be shared in the Autumn. As part of these arrangements there will be two additional checkpoints during hosting \u2013 Checkpoint 4 in November and Checkpoint 5 in January \u2013 both designed to further assure the CSSs\u2019 business plans. Full guidance on the balanced scorecard will be issued shortly. The Board Authority is currently working with CSSs on their development to ensure as much progress as possible is made by the end of August. Progress meetings will be taking place with all CSSs during July and again in August. Development plans will be updated in early July once the results of the \u2018at scale\u2019 tests are known and the relevant development needs have been identified from these assessments. The Checkpoint 3 documents are available on the in the CSS resources section . CSS \u2018externalisation\u2019 work gets underway The NHS Commissioning Board Authority is shortly to issue an invitation to tender for a company to prepare a report on commissioning support service (CSS) \u2018externalisation\u2019. The report will provide research and analysis on the options which are available to the NHSCB within this three year timescale. It will also provide advice on how to create a successful market for CSSs. The report is likely to be received in the autumn. The externalisation of the CSSs by the NHS Commissioning Board must be completed by April 2016 but must be considered alongside CCG plans to formally procure their commissioning support which they must do as soon as they are ready and willing. HR update Guidance is due to be published shortly for CSSs, confirming and clarifying the People Transition Policy and processes which need to be implemented. The guidance will cover timelines, pre-transfer selection and consultation arrangements. Any questions or requests for clarification should be emailed to: commissioningsupport@dh.gsi.gov.uk Communications and engagement services Preliminary returns have been received from commissioning support services (CSSs) that are interested in offering local and/or \u2018at scale\u2019 communications and engagement services and a number of CSSs have now expressed an interest in offering at scale services through a hub. Following this: SHA directors of commissioning development and directors of communication are leading local discussions to develop the best local model for these services in future All those who have expressed an interest in becoming a hub for the at scale elements have been sent the communications and engagement commissioning support quality standards. They have been asked to submit their proposals setting out how the hub will operate as part of a wider network by 9 July. Once the best shape for hub and network arrangements has been agreed, communications and engagement commissioning support functions will be incorporated as part of the over all CSS submission for Checkpoint 3 of the assurance process. News in brief CCGs in West Mercia have made their decisions about which commissioning support services (CSSs) they will use. CCGs in Shropshire, Telford and Wrekin and Herefordshire have elected to work with Staffordshire CSS, while CCGs in Worcestershire will work with Arden. The authorisation team at the NHS Commissioning Board Authority is producing a guide on the commissioning support tests by which the in-house support services in CCGs will be assessed. It will be available later this month. Further developments in the structure and responsibilities of the local area teams of the NHS Commissioning Board and clinical senates have been published. An updated Commissioning Support Services: Key Facts \u2013 a useful briefing tool for wider audiences \u2013 has been published on the NHS Commissioning Board Authority\u2019s website. Information has been released recently about the new single operating model for primary care commissioning, a proposed NHS Commissioning Assembly, involving NHS Commissioning Board directors and CCG clinical leaders, the CCG authorisation process and the CCG Code of Conduct.

      "title": "Board Authority appoints first CSS managing directors and announces decision to host | NHS England",
      "content": "The first round of appointments to commissioning support service (CSS) managing director posts has been made by the NHS Commissioning Board Authority. Nine appointments have been made, while discussions are ongoing with others. The successful appointees, and their current CSSs, are: Robert Bacon \u2013 Birmingham, Black Country and Solihull Commissioning Support Service Stephen Childs \u2013 North East Commissioning Support Keith Douglas \u2013 Commissioning Support South Jan Hull \u2013 Best West Commissioning Support Derek Kitchen \u2013 Staffordshire Commissioning Support Service Rachel Pearce \u2013 Arden Commissioning Support Service Andrew Ridley \u2013 North Central and East London Commissioning Support Service Ming Tang \u2013 CSS to be confirmed Sarah Whiting \u2013 North West London Commissioning Support Service. It the same time, the Board Authority has announced that all 23 CSSs will now proceed to be hosted by the NHS Commissioning Board from October 2012; a shift in emphasis brought about as a result of Checkpoint 2, where the numbers of CSSs reduced to 23, and subsequent further evaluation which has made it clear that each is viable in terms of scale. In addition, the Board Authority recognises the need for stability for CSSs and their customers to ensure a successful transition to the new clinical commissioning system. This decision will also ensure: there is stability and continuity for CCGs as they prepare for and progress through the authorisation process, and as they carry out the procurement of their choice of commissioning support post-April 2013 the CSS development process is better aligned with the national HR transition process CSSs can ensure they are the \u2018right size\u2019 \u2013 a process of ensuring their income covers their costs \u2013 in time for April 2013. Clearly, no CSSs will now be stopped at Checkpoint 3, although this does not rule out further size variation or adjustment to management configurations as a result of the assurance process. Instead, building on the outcome of Checkpoint 2 \u2013 where all 23 were judged to be viable \u2013 the focus will be on making sure all CSSs are as good as they can be by April 2013. Where there are still gaps in leadership appointments, the Board Authority has said that immediate leadership arrangements will be put in place to ensure that all CCGs receive the support they need for authorisation and transition, and to ensure that all CSSs are capable of continuing to progress at pace. In some cases, existing interim managing directors will continue in post, while in others there will be new interim management arrangements. Dame Barbara Hakin, National Director of Commissioning Development, said: \u201cI\u2019m very pleased to announce the first CSS managing director appointments. Many congratulations to the nine successful candidates and their teams; it is a very positive step to see the first appointments to these important new units and enables us now to proceed at pace in putting the full senior management teams in place and, following that, the wider staffing structure. \u201cThese are significant new roles, requiring a very broad set of skills and competencies and it is absolutely essential for the future sustainability of CSSs that we get these appointments right. \u201cI\u2019m also pleased to be able to announce a period of greater stability and continuity both for CSSs and CCGs, and for NHS staff who wish to transfer into CSSs. \u201cOur key focus now is to ensure that CSS development continues at a rapid pace over the next few months as we continue the recruitment process. I am confident that CSSs will continue to provide a good service to CCGs over the coming months and that, very soon, we will be making further very high calibre appointments.\u201d The external recruitment search process has already begun and an advert for the roles was placed in HSJ last week. Potential candidates for these roles will find further information on the CSS Leaders website . Comments on this page are now closed. Share: Tweet",

      "title": "NHS England \u00bb Proposals for authorisation conditions and support published",
      "content": "12 July 2012 - 14:13 Proposals for the final key elements of the authorisation governance process for CCGs, including the decision-making, moderation, conditions and support processes within the NHS Commissioning Board (NHS CB), have been published today. The information is in a paper to the NHS Commissioning Board Authority which will be asked to approve the proposals at its board meeting on 19 July 2012. The report to the Board identifies four key governance issues and the recommended approaches to each: The appointment of panel chairs and the make-up of authorisation panels Establishing the governance arrangements, including a new sub-committee of the NHS CB which would meet from October 2012 and make all the authorisation decisions The design of the moderation process for the outcomes of authorisation assessments The approach to applying conditions to authorisation, the support that will be made available to CCGs, and the design of the corresponding rectification plans. The authorisation decision-making and governance process will be overseen by two national directors at the NHS Commissioning Board: Dame Barbara Hakin, National Director of Commissioning Development, and Ian Dalton, Chief Operating Officer. Dame Barbara Hakin said: \u201cI\u2019m very pleased to propose further arrangements for providing support to CCG authorisation in accordance with the process we previously set out in the CCG applicants\u2019 guide. The overall aim of the authorisation process is to ensure that as many CCGs as possible are authorised and given the support they need to set themselves up by April 2013. \u201cThe process was developed by working with CCGs, national primary care organisations and other stakeholders and has been designed to be fair, transparent, rigorous and efficient. It must be robust enough to ensure CCGs meet the legal requirements for the establishment of new statutory organisations and are safe to proceed. But at the same time it must also balance rigour with a developmental approach.\u201d It is proposed that a Moderation Panel, chaired by Dame Barbara Hakin, is set up to ensure consistency. It would meet after the assessments for each wave had been completed. There are 119 authorisation criteria and it is proposed that each unmet criteria would have a standard condition applied to it and, if appropriate, one of a range of support options for that CCG. Following the Moderation Panel, the support would be decided by a Conditions Panel, chaired by Ian Dalton, which would also decide if a CCG is to be established without authorisation (shadow CCG). There would be seven types of support including: making advice and expertise available; providing a specific team or individual; appointing an alternative accountable officer; and removing functions. Having considered the recommendations of the moderation and conditions panels, Ian Dalton would make the final recommendations to the Board sub-committee regarding the authorisation status for each CCG \u2013 fully authorised or authorised with conditions (which includes established without authorisation). A rectification plan for each CCG would be agreed between the local area team director and the CCG after the sub-committee\u2019s final decision. This would set out the CCG\u2019s proposed response to achieve the threshold for each unmet criteria, allowing the conditions to be discharged. The purpose of the support and the rectification plan would be to ensure that a CCG is enabled to discharge its conditions as soon as possible before April 2013. As part of the initial authorisation assessment process, the site visit panels \u2013 which assess CCGs \u2013 will be led by experienced senior NHS directors and involve senior clinicians, local government, finance and commissioning experts, and patient/public representatives. Site visit panel chairs will be selected by Ian Dalton and will include regional directors, local area team directors and other directors of the Board Authority, and other senior commissioning leaders. All those taking part in the site visit panels will receive training to ensure a consistent and rigorous approach and the first group will do their training in July, ready for the first panels in September. It is proposed that each site visit panel chair does as many panels as possible to ensure that expertise is accumulated. The full paper \u2013 and all the papers for next week\u2019s board meeting \u2013 can be seen here: Board papers for 19th July Further details about the process will be made available in September.

      "content": "Preparations for the new commissioning world continue at a great pace and life seems no less hectic. Much of my time over the past few weeks has been taken up interviewing for Commissioning Support Service Managing Directors. The successful appointees were announced last week, and we are now into a second recruitment round, which will give senior NHS managers in SHAs and PCTs another chance to apply, but will also be wider, and including \u2018headhunting\u2019 managers from the NHS provider sector. It is my view that the best candidates will have \u201cgravitas and humility\u201d. I truly believe that the best people for most of these jobs are senior NHS managers who can demonstrate commercial acumen and an innovative approach. We have also decided to confirm that the 23 CSSs agreed at checkpoint 2 will proceed through 2013/14. All 23 are undoubtedly viable and CCGs need certainty about contracts. The precise size and management arrangements of the 23 will be determined as we move through the next few months and service level agreements with CCGs are signed. We are also, of course, currently focusing on Wave 1 authorisation and I am very pleased to say that we have received applications and supporting evidence from all 35 of the CCGs who agreed to submit. Additionally, we have now published a draft guide for assessors undertaking the desk top review of CCG applications. This guidance is intended to accompany Clinical commissioning group authorisation: Guide for applicants and should be used in conjunction with that document. Meanwhile, our work on the underpinning themes and rules is still as busy. The Health and Social Care Act 2012 sets out the high-level framework for the establishment of CCGs and provides for regulations to set out more specific provisions. The NHS (Clinical Commissioning Groups) Regulations 2012 were laid in Parliament on 26 June and make provision for the membership, names, establishment and governance of CCGs. A draft code of conduct has also been published which sets out additional safeguards that CCGs are advised to use when commissioning services for which GP practices could be potential providers. This is intended to both support CCGs in further developing their governance arrangements and to allow wider engagement on the proposals, which the NHS CB can then take into account when publishing statutory guidance later in the year. I am sure it is no less busy on the front line as practices and CCGs prepare for the future. As I go round the country, I am amazed at the progress everyone is making and the real improvements being made in patient care. Week by week we are moving ever closer to the new system going live on 1 April 2013 \u2013 an exciting prospect, but salutary I think! Comments on this page are now closed. Share: Tweet",

      "content": "The skies outside Quarry House were so exceptionally dull and grey, Angela\u2019s Ashes (1999) without the happy ending!, that even the thought of discussing the proposed final governance around CCG authorisation lifted my spirits! Only recently, I had chaired a session on Beyond Authorisation at the NHS Confederation conference at which the upbeat focus was all about CCG authorisation being a developmental means to a transformational end. The delegates heard first hand of two great examples of just that occurring in Newham and South Devon & Torbay. Now I was facing the hard nose reality of statutory accountability. My Stockholm Syndrome pained me slightly. On the one hand, the NHS CB will clearly need to have assured itself that placing billions of pounds into the hands CCGs is not akin to Other People\u2019s Money (1991) meets One flew over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest (1975). On the other hand, a clumsy approach could threaten the intended developmental nature of authorisation and, as a result, risk snatching defeat from the jaws of victory by signalling Groundhog Day (1993) for the NHS. If the authorisation process runs smoothly then CCGs and the panels responsible for assessing them should reach a shared position on a CCGs state for readiness and need for future developmental support. But then again, governance arrangements aren\u2019t really designed with things going well in mind. It was never going to be a less bureaucratic process than expected. Some first wave CCG leaders are reporting it has been more work than they anticipated but of value in their development to date. Throughout the authorisation process, I have a hunch that we should not lose sight of the fact that whilst we might build panels that are expert in authorisation, there is not, as yet, a sufficient wealth of expertise as to what constitutes excellence in newly forming CCGs for this to be an absolute assessment process. Whilst an evidence based approach clearly has merit it should not tie us to the past and successful innovation is usually spotted by most of us retrospectively as a result of the outcomes of the innovation, unless perhaps you are a venture capitalist! I wonder if we should have some of those on the assessment panel \u2026 on second thoughts \u2026 The Towering Inferno (1974) on the Titanic (1997) during Independence Day (1996) compounded by an Outbreak (1995) springs to mind! The authorisation process is intended to be developmental by nature, as we all need to be open to new learning. As the authorisation process runs its course, we should consider building in that new learning for both assessor and the assessed, disseminating learning both prospectively and retrospectively. My gloom was momentarily lifted as, on paper at least, it too seems that an effective balance between these two tensions may not be beyond us. The very real challenges that the staff recruitment presents to NHS CB were up next and ensured that the rest of the agenda could only get lighter. There is a self-obvious need to staff the organisation at pace but alongside what seems to be a genuine aspiration to forge a new organisation that values and engages its staff right from the outset, setting the tone for the rest of the NHS. Rather like a Need for Speed (in the planning and due out 2014) on The Job (2009) without going Back to the Future (1985). My Stockholm Syndrome niggled again as I wondered whether need always triumphs over aspiration. Whatever the outcome it is clear that it will not be perfect and, if judged on that basis, it will be deemed a failure. Ultimately, the aspiration will be judged by the behaviours that result from it. It would seem that the very senior manager positions will be crucial as they seek to develop and cascade the values of the NHS CB throughout the local area teams. The culture they create will not only dictate the immediate pace of change, but probably well into the future. To Be Continued (2008) \u2026 Footnote: Apparently, in Hollywood one of the key skills in pitching a new movie is being able to sum up its very essence in one sentence. Jaws in Space was not the pitch to describe the CCG authorisation process but for Alien (1979). The best attempt I have witnessed so far in applying this principle to Clinical Commissioning Groups comes from Gary Belfield, at a recent Westminster Forum, when he drew a parallel between the establishment of CCGs and the film Big (1988), starring Tom Hanks. You remember \u2026 the film in which the teenage boy wakes up one day in an adult\u2019s body etc. \u2026! I think it had a happy ending, but not before further transformation!

This puts us in a position to quickly develop the local presence of the NHS Commissioning Board, building strong relationships with our partners and communities to firmly focus on driving improvement for our patients.\u201d Background information about local area teams: There will be 27 local area teams with staff working from a number of office bases across their geographical area. All local area teams will have the same core functions around clinical commissioning group (CCG) development and assurance, emergency planning, resilience and response, quality and safety, configuration, system oversight and partnerships and stakeholder engagement, with the senior leadership of the local area team participating as a full partner on health and wellbeing boards. There will be variations around the scope of direct commissioning responsibilities. All local area teams will take on direct commissioning responsibilities for GP services, dental services, pharmacy and certain aspects of optical services, while ten local area teams will lead on specialised commissioning across England. A smaller number of local area teams will carry out the direct commissioning of other services, such as military and prison health. In London there will be a more integrated structure with one director for three local area teams working as an essential part of the overall pan-London arrangements for direct commissioning and functions supporting the delivery of service innovation. These arrangements reflect both the distinct nature of the London region and the need to ensure effective working with partners at both a borough and London-wide level. The NHS Commissioning Board takes on its full statutory responsibilities in April 2013. In the meantime, all current NHS planning and delivery responsibilities remain with the Department of Health, strategic health authorities and primary care trusts. The next round of recruitment to the remaining director posts is taking place shortly. For further information about local area teams please see our local area team briefing pack .

A key feature of the new arrangements is the formation of Local Health Resilience Partnerships (LHRPs). The Department of Health (DH) has published a letter and resource pack which provides information to support the roll out of LHRPs . LHRPs will provide strategic forums for joint planning for emergencies for the new health system and will support the health sector\u2019s contribution to multi-agency planning through LRFs (Local Resilience Fora). They are not statutory organisations and accountability for emergency preparedness and response remains with individual organisations. The new system will offer benefits including: a more consistent approach across England, permitting better understanding of health preparedness at LRF level and nationally leadership of planning at a senior level with a focus on cross-agency preparedness opportunity for better integration between health and local government emergency planning The materials have been co-produced by the NHS, HPA, Public Health and DH with advice from key stakeholders in local government and the wider resilience community. They comprise: a summary of the principal EPRR roles for health sector organisations a model terms of reference for LHRPs a model concept of operations for LHRPs The NHS Commissioning Board Authority (NHS CBA) will lead the roll out of LHRPs for each LRF area, working with the local health community, local government and LRFs. Further information and guidance will be provided shortly. System assurance of the new response arrangements will be provided through a series of four regionally based exercises in the North, Midlands and East, the South and London between November 2012 and March 2013. These exercises will involve multi-agency partners and plans are currently under development. Share: Tweet",

This is why I have started work on a new vision for nursing, something I hope will support nurses and midwives everywhere to improve the care we give our patients as well as building strength into our profession. My starting point for this work is the five areas I think define good nursing. I call these the five Cs. We show care and compassion in how we look after patients; we find the courage to do the right thing, even if that means standing up to senior people to act for the patient\u2019s best interests in a complex and pressured environment; we demonstrate commitment to our patients and profession and finally we make sure we communicate at all times. I believe these five areas define nursing as a profession and by focusing on these values, we can achieve our aims of improving care for our patients and strengthening the profession. For instance, I think a good nurse will show care and compassion to his or her patients, but also demonstrate care for a colleague who is having a difficult day. Supporting colleagues is important because nursing is a hard job, and we do have tough days. But, we cannot let our patients down because we are distracted so we need to look after each other as colleagues, so that we can give the best care to our patients So good patient care and experience is also dependent on good staff care and a positive workplace experience. To help me develop the vision and most importantly how we are going to involve as many nurses as possible in this, I asked a group of nurse leaders to spend time thinking through some of the issues around nursing and midwifery. Among these issues are getting staffing right and staff experience. I\u2019ll be able to give you more details about how we will go about building this vision soon. My ambition is to involve as many nurses, midwives and health care assistants so that we can build on their experience and use their ideas. I know from the enthusiasm and energy of this landmark meeting that there is a commitment to improve from nurses and midwives everywhere. Comments on this page are now closed. Share: Tweet",

      "content": "Health Secretary Andrew Lansley today set out new care objectives for the improvement of health and healthcare, with the publication of a draft mandate \u2013 Our NHS care objectives: a draft mandate to the NHS Commissioning Board \u2013 which sets out the expectations for the health service and marks the move to a more patient centred, independent, transparent and outcomes focused NHS. Professor Malcolm Grant, Chair of the NHS Commissioning Board Authority said: \u201cFor the first time the Government is setting out for public consultation, in this single statement, the improvements in health outcomes for the people of England that it expects the NHS to deliver in the coming years. In focusing explicitly on outcomes \u2013 such as reductions in premature deaths, and improving the experience of patients \u2013 rather than on processes and operational targets, it kicks off a fresh approach that has the potential to truly liberate the NHS. The idea is to give clinical leaders the freedom to innovate rather than tying them to centrally determined processes and subjecting them to detailed day to day political control. \u201cHence the Department of Health\u2019s consultation on the mandate provides an important opportunity for all those who share this determination to focus on real improvements in health outcomes to influence the way the future NHS operates in order to bring this about. \u201cI am convinced that the best way to do this is to keep the mandate focused on improving overall outcomes for patients, rather than clogging it up with a range of narrowly conceived targets. That would work in the opposite direction by stifling the very freedom and innovation that is essential for clinically-led future change that puts the patient at the centre of the system. \u201cThat is the fundamental test against which we will be assessing the draft mandate, and we would encourage others to do the same.\u201d The government is now seeking public feedback on the draft care objectives www.mandate.dh.gov.uk . The consultation period will run from 4 July to 26 September. Responses will help to inform the final care objectives, which will be published in Autumn 2012, before they officially come into force in April 2013. Comments on this page are now closed.

      "content": "The NHS Commissioning Board Authority Chief Executive David Nicholson and a \u2018design group\u2019 of 15 CCG clinical leaders have written to emerging CCG leaders this week to invite one senior clinical lead from each CCG to join a new NHS Commissioning Assembly. The executive team at the Board Authority and the group of CCG leaders have worked together to identify the key principles on which the relationships between CCGs and the NHS Commissioning Board (NHSCB) will depend and a proposal for how to take this collaboration forward. The proposal builds on feedback from emerging CCG clinical leaders at workshops in December 2011 and January 2012, and has been tested more widely in informal discussions since. The group is also seeking views on a draft shared statement of intent and a draft framework for relationships for use as the basis for the development of relationships at a local and national level between CCGs and the NHSCB. The assembly will bring together leaders from all CCGs and the NHSCB with the following purpose and roles: To create shared leadership at national level across all clinical commissioners, fostering the sense of \u2018one team\u2019 with joint responsibility for ensuring that clinically-led commissioning develops and flourishes To be the infrastructure through which CCGs and the NHSCB can co-produce national strategy and direction To be the mechanism through which CCGs can build consensus and have a common voice on key issues To be a learning network through which leaders of NHSCB and CCGs can develop commissioning to be the best it can be To facilitate communication between leaders of the clinical commissioning system at a national level. A shared work programme is also being suggested with CCG leaders coming together in smaller groups to work collectively on areas of key importance including quality, financial strategy, incentives and primary care.

      "title": "NHS England \u00bb Board Authority appoints first CSS managing directors and announces decision to host",
      "content": "The first round of appointments to commissioning support service (CSS) managing director posts has been made by the NHS Commissioning Board Authority. Nine appointments have been made, while discussions are ongoing with others. The successful appointees, and their current CSSs, are: Robert Bacon \u2013 Birmingham, Black Country and Solihull Commissioning Support Service Stephen Childs \u2013 North East Commissioning Support Keith Douglas \u2013 Commissioning Support South Jan Hull \u2013 Best West Commissioning Support Derek Kitchen \u2013 Staffordshire Commissioning Support Service Rachel Pearce \u2013 Arden Commissioning Support Service Andrew Ridley \u2013 North Central and East London Commissioning Support Service Ming Tang \u2013 CSS to be confirmed Sarah Whiting \u2013 North West London Commissioning Support Service. It the same time, the Board Authority has announced that all 23 CSSs will now proceed to be hosted by the NHS Commissioning Board from October 2012; a shift in emphasis brought about as a result of Checkpoint 2, where the numbers of CSSs reduced to 23, and subsequent further evaluation which has made it clear that each is viable in terms of scale. In addition, the Board Authority recognises the need for stability for CSSs and their customers to ensure a successful transition to the new clinical commissioning system. This decision will also ensure: there is stability and continuity for CCGs as they prepare for and progress through the authorisation process, and as they carry out the procurement of their choice of commissioning support post-April 2013 the CSS development process is better aligned with the national HR transition process CSSs can ensure they are the \u2018right size\u2019 \u2013 a process of ensuring their income covers their costs \u2013 in time for April 2013. Clearly, no CSSs will now be stopped at Checkpoint 3, although this does not rule out further size variation or adjustment to management configurations as a result of the assurance process. Instead, building on the outcome of Checkpoint 2 \u2013 where all 23 were judged to be viable \u2013 the focus will be on making sure all CSSs are as good as they can be by April 2013. Where there are still gaps in leadership appointments, the Board Authority has said that immediate leadership arrangements will be put in place to ensure that all CCGs receive the support they need for authorisation and transition, and to ensure that all CSSs are capable of continuing to progress at pace. In some cases, existing interim managing directors will continue in post, while in others there will be new interim management arrangements. Dame Barbara Hakin, National Director of Commissioning Development, said: \u201cI\u2019m very pleased to announce the first CSS managing director appointments. Many congratulations to the nine successful candidates and their teams; it is a very positive step to see the first appointments to these important new units and enables us now to proceed at pace in putting the full senior management teams in place and, following that, the wider staffing structure. \u201cThese are significant new roles, requiring a very broad set of skills and competencies and it is absolutely essential for the future sustainability of CSSs that we get these appointments right. \u201cI\u2019m also pleased to be able to announce a period of greater stability and continuity both for CSSs and CCGs, and for NHS staff who wish to transfer into CSSs. \u201cOur key focus now is to ensure that CSS development continues at a rapid pace over the next few months as we continue the recruitment process. I am confident that CSSs will continue to provide a good service to CCGs over the coming months and that, very soon, we will be making further very high calibre appointments.\u201d The external recruitment search process has already begun and an advert for the roles was placed in HSJ last week. Potential candidates for these roles will find further information on the CSS Leaders website . Comments on this page are now closed. Topics Commissioning",

Wave one is the first of four waves of applications from CCGs which are to be submitted from July to November 2012. Dame Barbara Hakin, National Director for Commissioning Development at the Board Authority, said: \u201cI am delighted that the CCG authorisation process is beginning on schedule and that we have received all 35 applications in full from the CCGs in wave one. I wish to thank CCGs for their energy and commitment; all CCGs are working incredibly hard to set themselves up as effective and safe health commissioning organisations by April 2013 and it is inspiring to see the process get off to a good start. \u201cI want to emphasise strongly that all the authorisation waves are equal and there is no difference between a CCG in wave one or wave four in terms of competence. Proposed CCGs in each wave will continue to develop throughout the year as they take on increasing responsibilities, and could have conditions set irrespective of the wave in which they are placed.\u201d CCGs are new, clinically-led organisations coming into being for the first time and the NHS Commissioning Board is responsible for supporting the development of CCGs as they move through authorisation. For this reason, the thresholds for authorisation reflect the current stage of CCG development, and are set in the context of the longer-term vision. Alongside the responsibility to provide support, the NHS Commissioning Board has a parallel duty to assure that CCGs are able to commission safely, use their budgets responsibly, and exercise their functions to improve quality, reduce inequality and deliver improved outcomes within the available resources. The outcome of wave one is due to be considered by the NHS Commissioning Board in October 2012. The application for authorisation comprises an application form on which the CCG must self-certify its compliance in a number of areas and up to 19 core evidence documents. In addition the CCG may choose to submit other documents. The full list of authorisation waves is available here. Comments on this page are now closed. Topics Commissioning",

This puts us in a position to quickly develop the local presence of the NHS Commissioning Board, building strong relationships with our partners and communities to firmly focus on driving improvement for our patients.\u201d Background information about local area teams: There will be 27 local area teams with staff working from a number of office bases across their geographical area. All local area teams will have the same core functions around clinical commissioning group (CCG) development and assurance, emergency planning, resilience and response, quality and safety, configuration, system oversight and partnerships and stakeholder engagement, with the senior leadership of the local area team participating as a full partner on health and wellbeing boards. There will be variations around the scope of direct commissioning responsibilities. All local area teams will take on direct commissioning responsibilities for GP services, dental services, pharmacy and certain aspects of optical services, while ten local area teams will lead on specialised commissioning across England. A smaller number of local area teams will carry out the direct commissioning of other services, such as military and prison health. In London there will be a more integrated structure with one director for three local area teams working as an essential part of the overall pan-London arrangements for direct commissioning and functions supporting the delivery of service innovation. These arrangements reflect both the distinct nature of the London region and the need to ensure effective working with partners at both a borough and London-wide level. The NHS Commissioning Board takes on its full statutory responsibilities in April 2013. In the meantime, all current NHS planning and delivery responsibilities remain with the Department of Health, strategic health authorities and primary care trusts. The next round of recruitment to the remaining director posts is taking place shortly. For further information about local area teams please see our local area team briefing pack .

      "title": "NHS England \u00bb Proposals for authorisation conditions and support published",
      "content": "Proposals for the final key elements of the authorisation governance process for CCGs, including the decision-making, moderation, conditions and support processes within the NHS Commissioning Board (NHS CB), have been published today. The information is in a paper to the NHS Commissioning Board Authority which will be asked to approve the proposals at its board meeting on 19 July 2012. The report to the Board identifies four key governance issues and the recommended approaches to each: The appointment of panel chairs and the make-up of authorisation panels Establishing the governance arrangements, including a new sub-committee of the NHS CB which would meet from October 2012 and make all the authorisation decisions The design of the moderation process for the outcomes of authorisation assessments The approach to applying conditions to authorisation, the support that will be made available to CCGs, and the design of the corresponding rectification plans. The authorisation decision-making and governance process will be overseen by two national directors at the NHS Commissioning Board: Dame Barbara Hakin, National Director of Commissioning Development, and Ian Dalton, Chief Operating Officer. Dame Barbara Hakin said: \u201cI\u2019m very pleased to propose further arrangements for providing support to CCG authorisation in accordance with the process we previously set out in the CCG applicants\u2019 guide. The overall aim of the authorisation process is to ensure that as many CCGs as possible are authorised and given the support they need to set themselves up by April 2013. \u201cThe process was developed by working with CCGs, national primary care organisations and other stakeholders and has been designed to be fair, transparent, rigorous and efficient. It must be robust enough to ensure CCGs meet the legal requirements for the establishment of new statutory organisations and are safe to proceed. But at the same time it must also balance rigour with a developmental approach.\u201d It is proposed that a Moderation Panel, chaired by Dame Barbara Hakin, is set up to ensure consistency. It would meet after the assessments for each wave had been completed. There are 119 authorisation criteria and it is proposed that each unmet criteria would have a standard condition applied to it and, if appropriate, one of a range of support options for that CCG. Following the Moderation Panel, the support would be decided by a Conditions Panel, chaired by Ian Dalton, which would also decide if a CCG is to be established without authorisation (shadow CCG). There would be seven types of support including: making advice and expertise available; providing a specific team or individual; appointing an alternative accountable officer; and removing functions. Having considered the recommendations of the moderation and conditions panels, Ian Dalton would make the final recommendations to the Board sub-committee regarding the authorisation status for each CCG \u2013 fully authorised or authorised with conditions (which includes established without authorisation). A rectification plan for each CCG would be agreed between the local area team director and the CCG after the sub-committee\u2019s final decision. This would set out the CCG\u2019s proposed response to achieve the threshold for each unmet criteria, allowing the conditions to be discharged. The purpose of the support and the rectification plan would be to ensure that a CCG is enabled to discharge its conditions as soon as possible before April 2013. As part of the initial authorisation assessment process, the site visit panels \u2013 which assess CCGs \u2013 will be led by experienced senior NHS directors and involve senior clinicians, local government, finance and commissioning experts, and patient/public representatives. Site visit panel chairs will be selected by Ian Dalton and will include regional directors, local area team directors and other directors of the Board Authority, and other senior commissioning leaders. All those taking part in the site visit panels will receive training to ensure a consistent and rigorous approach and the first group will do their training in July, ready for the first panels in September. It is proposed that each site visit panel chair does as many panels as possible to ensure that expertise is accumulated. The full paper \u2013 and all the papers for next week\u2019s board meeting \u2013 can be seen here: Board papers for 19th July Further details about the process will be made available in September.

      "content": "Lay Assessors on CCG authorisation panels The NHS Commissioning Board Authority is currently working towards the authorisation of clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) and would like to work with patients and the public to ensure they are ready to take up their new role from April 2013. CCGs are the new clinically-led and patient-focused organisations who will be responsible for commissioning many of your local health services. Each CCG will be assessed by authorisation panels prior to being authorised to begin their new role. The Board Authority is now looking for people to become Lay Assessors to take part in the authorisation panel visits to proposed CCGs, alongside other panellists from the NHS and Local Authorities. The panels will assess each CCG\u2019s capability to deliver their new commissioning role. No formal qualifications are required, just a commitment to support the development of the new health system, an objective approach, a genuine interest in participation and an ability to constructively challenge the views and assumptions of senior/board level professionals. Lay Assessors are not expected to be experts in any specific field but are expected to bring their own experience and an independent view to the assessment . The role will require a commitment of approximately three to five days, plus training and development support to enable the assessors to carry out the role successfully. The Board Authority will also work with the Lay Assessors to learn from their experience and improve how it works collaboratively with patients and the public in the future. This will be a rolling programme over the next few months and so recruitment will begin on Monday 9 July and continue to Tuesday 31 July.

      "content": "NICE and the NHS Information Centre for Health and Social Care have published their recommendations for which health care measures are suitable to go in the Commissioning Outcomes Framework for 2013/14. The NHS Commissioning Board Authority (NHS CBA) asked these two organisations to carry out this advisory work in order to draw on NICE\u2019s access to clinical advice and the Information Centre\u2019s expertise in data collection. These recommendations come at a key stage in the development of the Commissioning Outcomes Framework. The Framework will play an important role in driving up quality in the new system. Covering \u00a360 billion of health services commissioned by CCGs across the NHS it will help translate the NHS Outcomes Framework into clear, comparative data on the quality of services that CCGs deliver for their local populations and the outcomes achieved for patients. The Framework will focus on quality and reducing health inequalities Taking this set of recommendations the NHS CBA will work with the CCGs and other stakeholders to develop the Commissioning Outcomes Framework so that it can support and recognise quality improvement. The NHS CBA is organizing a series of regional workshops and engagement events in August and September and a national stakeholder meeting on 12 September 2012. These events will help people find the right balance of measures to drive quality improvement and help the NHS Commissioning Board to hold CCGs to account. The NHS CBA will release its Commissioning Outcomes Framework for 2013/14 in the Autumn so that CCGs can use it in their planning for the next year. Follow this link to see the NICE recommendations .

      "content": "If the first half of last month\u2019s FDG meeting caused an acute exacerbation of my Stockholm Syndrome then the second half offered hope of some relief. Having a vision for the NHS seems to have become somewhat unfashionable, Spice World (1997) set to the Sound of Music (1965). Yet if we are unable to imagine, and agree, what the future could, or even should look like, then how are we going to plan for and build it? If we are going to allow the imagination of newly empowered clinicians to design the NHS what sort of Impressionism will we witness? Or will innovation be determined by national bodies resulting in something that is more akin to painting by numbers, with all it\u2019s inherent strengths and weaknesses? In June this year I came away from my first NHS Confederation conference with Malcolm Grant\u2019s words on the style of the NHS CB ringing in my ears, \u201cNO MORE TOP DOWN!\u201d However, this seemed to be at odds with Dame Ruth Carnell\u2019s comments the previous day, when talking about major service reconfiguration, reasserting the value of a top down approach. Yet I am fairly certain that I heard Sir David Nicholson give plaudits to both of them. The ringing in my ears was soon surpassed by an aching in my frontal cortex as I wondered where this really left the NHS, somewhere between Animal Farm (1957) and 1984 (1984)? In reality of course the polarisation of the debate belittles its complexity. Perhaps one significant underlying source of both the failure or success of previous visions for the NHS is the degree of connection between national and local voices within the NHS and the degree to which the public voice has been suppressed or augmented. Which in itself is an over simplification akin to gravity plating in Star Trek (1979). However, I also came away from the NHS Confederation conference challenged by Ben Page, CEO Ipsos MORI , who politely suggested that the NHS would be better off explaining the benefits it is seeking to achieve before asking everyone what they thought of its solutions. This thread has been running through a series of FDG meetings \u2013 considering what role the NHSCB might take in supporting a national dialogue that connects the national and local leadership with the public in search of a broad brush vision for the NHS that Cheryl could articulate to Simon, the nation\u2019s very own My Fair Lady (1964) bringing the The Truman Show (1998) to the NHS in the hope of unlocking the potential of The Social Network (2010). Arguably, the secret, and greatest challenge, to success lies in the collective nature of such a vision. It will require aligning leadership throughout the NHS but crucially also well beyond. Whilst it would not be difficult to argue that this is somewhat overdue, on the face of it the task is formidable. If the NHS is to add years to life through better health outcomes and financial sustainability, in the midst of the longest recession since World War 2, then it will need to undergo significant service reconfiguration. The planning and building stages of any vision will bring their own challenges, such as delivering integrated care with the current NHS IT infrastructure \u2013 if not Mission Impossible (1996) then certainly much harder than it could be. The longer we delay the inevitable the more difficult the task will become. To stand a chance of achieving this then CCGs will need to work with each other across larger population sizes. The NHS CB and CCGs will need to coordinate their commissioning operations to best effect for their shared population and also oversee coordinated infrastructure development. Critically both will need to engage with the population to agree a common understanding of what needs to be achieved and a common currency for both articulating the intended benefits and with which to measure the outcomes. The perfect antidote for my Stockholm Syndrome? On the way home that evening there was a storm whilst the train was standing at Grantham Station. Dark skies tricked the street lights in to a false start and provided an appropriate back drop to spectacular lightning strikes just the other side of the tracks. As we travelled further south, the clouds lightened and then broke resulting in glorious blue skies. With my Stockholm Syndrome now a distant memory I reflected on whether The Perfect Storm (2000) had served as an Omen (1976) for the journey that we are all embarking on!

      "content": "The report of the first CCG and commissioning support service (CSS) scenario workshop has been published on the NHS Commissioning Board Authority\u2019s website. Steering or Rowing? Report from a simulation event which tested how CCGs might utilise CSSs The event, which was run in partnership with NHS Clinical Commissioners, and organised by the Health Services Management Centre at the University of Birmingham, involved more than 40 leaders from CCGs, CSSs and the independent sector. Its aim was to explore the relationships between CCGs and CSSs, and to anticipate some of the likely challenges for CCGs and CSSs so that the NHS Commissioning Board Authority (NHS CBA) and partners can focus developmental activities effectively in the coming months. Dame Barbara Hakin, National Director of Commissioning Development, said: \u201cCCGs and CSUs are developing in tandem, and thanks to their hard work they are on track to meet key milestones in the establishment of the new clinical commissioning system. \u201cThere is still a great deal of work to do to ensure that clinical commissioners have all the support they need and we have used the insights from this report to inform the next phase of the NHS Commissioning Board Authority\u2019s programme of practical, targeted CCG and CSU development support over the coming months.\u201d Key insights from the event include: The customer /supplier relationship between CCGs and CSSs should be actively explored and tested in the workplace, until an acceptable balance is achieved which produces the best results for both parties. Whilst the subject of leadership is complex and situational (i.e. different styles are more effective in different situations) the prevailing commentary currently is that distributive leadership is the preferred style to operate successfully in a localised, flexible system without a designated system manager. New leaders and new organisations may benefit from leadership development to adapt their styles and hone their skills. Organisations within the system will need to learn when and how to take up authority, and when to allow others to lead. This requires sophisticated relationships, processes and leadership behaviours in order to succeed, and this is as much a requirement for CSSs as CCGs, as they develop their organisational forms and function. CCGs will need to use CSSs to free themselves up from the detailed operational issues in order for them to focus on system and strategic issues. The clinical leader\u2019s role needs to be well supported by other commissioning team members and their expertise recognised and used effectively. The vital role of the wider multi-disciplinary team in offering expert advice and support to the commissioning process needs to be considered in practice by CCGs Prospective CCGs should draw on the national work framing the unique contribution of clinicians to commissioning to help focus how they use clinical time. The Board Authority is using the insights from the report to inform its approach to CCG and commissioning support development over the coming months, and is providing a programme of targeted, practical support to CCGs and CSSs including: Guidance for CCGs and CSUs on collaborative commissioning arrangements. Guidance for CCGs on procuring clinical services. Exploring with CCGs the potential procurement options for buying commissioning support. The draft mandate to the NHS Commissioning Board \u2013 Our NHS Care Objectives , which is currently subject to consultation \u2013 outlines that the NHS CB will need to set up a new procurement framework to enable CCGs to procure from providers. A market development group that includes representatives from local authorities and the independent sector to develop a long term market development strategy for commissioning support. As part of this workstream, there will be a series of \u2018market days\u2019 for CCGs later in 2012. These will support CCGs to become more informed customers of commissioning support.

Also congratulations to the newly appointed commissioning support unit (CSU) managing directors. Very welcome appointments all. In this issue I\u2019m pleased we\u2019re also able to report the outcome of the business review of \u2018scale\u2019 services. These configurations \u2013 along with the appointment of 15 managing directors, and the decision made last month that the NHS Commissioning Board (NHSCB) will host 23 CSUs \u2013 go a long way to providing stability and enabling CSUs to take forward their work with confidence. Clearly, there is a great deal of work to be done and a lot to be gained over the coming period as we start to put the final structures, plans and arrangements in place to develop a sustainable network of CSUs. This work will now be led by the CSU Transition Programme team which will be fully put in place over the coming weeks. The commissioning support strategy, market development and externalisation team will work closely with the transition team and ensure the longer-term programme is developed and delivered. Key pieces of work will include the development of a standard contract, an options appraisal of externalisation options, a CCG procurement framework, market development, and commercial development for CSUs. The CSU Network \u2013 which involves the Board Authority\u2019s team and CSU managing directors \u2013 met this week to discuss key elements of both the transition and longer-term programmes. An important discussion took place on hosting, the hosting charge, the licence to operate and governance. There is more work to be done before we are ready to publish the hosting guidance in October but a key message is that the NHSCB is keen to keen to strike the right balance between accountability and flexibility and, crucially, will need CSU support to make this approach work effectively. On the licence to operate, CSUs are likely to be licensed to support CCGs to commission from the moment of authorisation. We have still to define what this will mean, and the relationship between CSUs and the NHSCB in terms of freedoms, intervention and delegation, and the hosting guidance will describe this further. The network also heard an initial outline of what the NHSCB is likely to want to commission from CSUs, a session on equalities, and speakers from John Lewis and the Cabinet Office. I also want to emphasise the importance of Checkpoint 3 and be clear that the outcomes will feed into the licence to operate decision. Our plan is to make the assessment as rigorous and robust as possible with clear interventions put in place for any plans that do not meet expectations. It is important to note that there may still be potential variations in size and shape, along with adjustments to management configurations, to ensure that all CSUs are as efficient as they can possibly be. Finally, I wish you all a pleasant summer and \u2013 as I will be leaving at the end of August \u2013 thank you for your contributions to the development of CSUs and wish you all very well for the future. Please do continue to keep in touch with the team and let them have your thoughts and feedback on any aspects of our work. To send your comments, or join our mailing list, contact us at commissioningsupport@dh.gsi.gov.uk Dr Joe Rafferty Director of Commissioning Support Commissioning support appointments The NHS Commissioning Board Authority has this week appointed Bob Ricketts as Director of Commissioning Support Strategy and Market Development in its Commissioning Development Directorate. Bob is currently Director of Provider Policy at the Department of Health. In addition, Andrew Kenworthy \u2013 currently Chief Executive of NHS South East London PCT Cluster \u2013 will be joining the Board Authority\u2019s Commissioning Development Directorate via an IMAS assignment as Director of Commissioning Support Unit (CSU) Transition Programme until a substantive appointment is made. The following CSU managing director posts have also been recruited to: Alison Hughes , West Yorkshire CSU (previously interim managing director for West Yorkshire CSU) Nick Relph , South London CSU (previously interim managing director for South London CSU) Daryl Robertson , Kent and Medway CSU (previously interim managing director for Kent and Medway CSU) Maddy Ruff , North Yorkshire and Humber CSU (previously interim managing director for North Yorkshire and Humber CSU) Clodagh Warde Robinson , Surrey and Sussex CSU (previously Deputy Chief Executive/Director of Strategy and New Business at Sussex Community NHS Trust). In addition, Professor John Parkes was announced as managing director of Greater East Midlands CSU on 16 July \u2013 he was previously Chief Executive of Chief Executive of NHS Milton Keynes and NHS Northamptonshire PCT Cluster. The interview and recruitment process is ongoing for the remaining eight CSU managing director posts. Configuration of \u2018scale\u2019 services finalised The outcome of the business review and assurance process for the majority of the \u2018scale\u2019 commissioning support services has been agreed. CSUs which applied to provide scale services were assessed by the Board Authority according to a set of tests to ensure that: They are able to deliver against defined standards, based on current industry standards The cost structure is appropriate and sustainable There is the right capacity and capability to deliver high quality services across the appropriate geographical footprint. The tests were designed to ensure that the services provided by the CSUs are built upon best practice industry standards so that they remain competitive in a future market once CCGs begin to undertake their procurements for commissioning support. The Board Authority has named those CSUs which will be offering business intelligence, healthcare (clinical) procurement, and business support services \u2013 three of the four scale services. Work is ongoing to finalise the configuration for the communications and engagement services and there are likely to be four or five centres. Business intelligence Business intelligence services comprise data management and integration centres that provide data validation, integration and storage to cleanse, validate and link national and local data sets, so that meaningful conformed data is available for further analysis by CCGs and CSUs. All nine CSUs which submitted applications have been approved to provide business intelligence services. The nine centres are: North West collaborative; North East and North Yorkshire and Humber collaborative; South and West Yorkshire collaborative; Greater East Midlands; London collaborative; South collaborative; Central Southern; Best West; Birmingham, Black Country and Solihull. A number of CSUs are still considering their arrangements to deliver these services. Healthcare (clinical) procurement Healthcare (clinical) procurement services comprise: market management activities such as market engagement, market analysis and market development; and procurement strategy and activities such as procurement project management, commercial and procurement strategy development, or technical advice around process compliance. Thirteen CSUs were approved to provide healthcare (clinical) procurement services. These are: North West collaborative; North East; South Yorkshire and Bassetlaw; Greater East Midlands; Norfolk and Waveney; Essex; North Central and East London; North West London; Surrey and Sussex; Commissioning Support South; Central Southern; Best West; Birmingham, Black Country and Solihull. A number of CSUs are still considering their arrangements to deliver these services and will be assessed accordingly. Business support Business support services include HR, payroll, procurement of goods and services, legal services, and information management and technology. Following assessment, all CSUs are planning to provide or source these services on behalf of their customers and are currently developing their plans to ensure they meet industry standards and benchmarks so that they remain competitive in a future market environment.

The outcome of Checkpoint 3 will be a provisional \u2018licence to operate\u2019 for each CSU. This will have conditions attached if the CSU needs further development and support. Detail will also be given about the next steps in the CCG and CSU staff surveys and the CSU site visits. These will take place in October and the panel will include representatives from the NHS Commissioning Board Authority and SHA clusters and independent business experts. The outcomes of Checkpoint 3 will be moderated and are due to be presented to the NHS Commissioning Board in October. CSUs will also receive guidance on the balanced scorecard, the principal tool by which the Board Authority will track and monitor CSU development, this week. CCG authorisation: Commissioning support supplement A supplement has been produced for CCG authorisation assessors which focuses on CCGs\u2019 commissioning support arrangements. It particularly looks at the tests that will be applied for those CCGs which will be providing all their support functions \u2018in house\u2019. The purpose of the document is to help assessors determine whether CCGs have assessed the quality and value-for-money of their support arrangements (whether these are in-house, shared or bought in) and that the evidence submitted is sufficiently robust and can be assessed transparently, consistently and fairly. The document sits alongside the other assessor guides and is available on the resources for authorisation page . HR update A draft guide to help commissioning support units (CSUs) with HR and recruitment has been circulated for comments to CSUs. CSUs will be large organisations with a significant turnover so it is vital that they secure the best talent from the outset and that appointments are made in a timely way which enables staff to make the right choice of roles. At the same time, newly appointed managing directors should have the opportunity to create the structures they see as optimum for their organisation, within principles agreed with the unions. Appointments and transfers of staff must be in line with the principles in the overarching HR Transition Framework and the People Transition Policy for the NHS Commissioning Board, and the national policy and process on filling of posts in receiving organisations. The governing body of a CSU cannot be a \u2018Board\u2019 or have non-executive directors. CSUs are however encouraged to consider proxy arrangements to ensure lay involvement. In addition, three further generic \u2018Very Senior Manager\u2019 CSU job descriptions for the following roles have been developed: chief operating officer, director of HR and corporate governance and director of commercial and contracting services. These job descriptions are currently being evaluated. While there is no mandate to use these job descriptions, the intention is that they can be used by managing directors to quickly identify successful candidates for senior roles within their senior leadership teams. Finally a Commissioning Support HR Working Group has been established, chaired by Jan Hull, Managing Director, Best West CSU. Its initial priority is the development of an HR framework, within the overall governance requirement of the NHS Commissioning Board Authority. Debbie Hilditch, South Yorkshire and Bassetlaw CSU, will also pay a key role in the group, particularly supporting Jan in her work as Chair. The group will consist of up to three HR and organisational development directors and up to five HR practitioners. CSU managing directors have been asked to send in their nominees for the group and the first meeting will be in August. Finance director appointments process The commissioning support unit (CSU) finance director appointment process will begin on 10 August with the launch of a dedicated recruitment website. The appointing officer for these vacancies will be the substantive managing director for each CSU. Where a substantive postholder is not in place, the appointing officer will be a finance professional at \u2018Very Senior Manager\u2019 grade nominated by Paul Baumann, Chief Financial Officer, NHS Commissioning Board Authority. The finance director appointment process will include a first phase for those \u2018at risk and affected by change\u2019. The process will be managed by the Board Authority and all NHS candidates will complete a finance accreditation process. The closing date for applications is 24 August and interviews will commence in September. A second recruitment phase will be used if there are any remaining vacancies after the first phase. Branding and identity Following the recent announcement that all 23 NHS commissioning support units will progress to be hosted by the NHS Commissioning Board during the transitional period, a decision has been made to clarify the naming conventions. The NHS Commissioning Board Authority is now using the term \u2018commissioning support unit\u2019 or \u2018CSU\u2019, rather than \u2018commissioning support service\u2019 or \u2018CSS\u2019 so it can begin to distinguish these NHS units from the wider commissioning support services market place. With regards to branding, whilst it is clear that, as hosted NHS organisations, overarching NHS branding rules and guidelines apply, the Board Authority will want to provide as much flexibility as possible so that each CSU can operate along commercial lines. The plan at the moment is to ask each CSU to submit applications for its future name/identity as part of the full business plan which, pending approval by the Board, will be agreed as part of the license to operate arrangements. Ready reckoner 2 An updated version of the \u2018ready reckoner\u2019 running costs tool has been made available to CCGs this week. The ready reckoner is an interactive tool that enables CCGs to work through the implications of different commissioning support arrangements and delivery models. It provides the flexibility to work through the potential impact that different populations have on resources and the potential costs for different internal staffing structures and commissioning support options. It should support CCGs in discussions with PCT clusters and other CCGs about where it makes sense to share functions and enter into more federated models in order to generate better value for money and ensure that future commissioning support arrangements are: of sound quality affordable responsive to their needs. The tool can be downloaded from the CCG development section of the CCG resources page of the NHS Commissioinng Board Authority\u2019s website. Scenario report helps shape CCG development The report of the first CCG and commissioning support unit (CSU) scenario workshop has been published on this website. The event, which was run in partnership with NHS Clinical Commissioners, and organised by the Health Services Management Centre at the University of Birmingham, involved more than 40 leaders from CCGs, CSUs and the independent sector. Its aim was to explore the relationships between CCGs and CSUs, and to anticipate some of the likely challenges for CCGs and CSUs so that the Board Authority and partners can focus developmental activities effectively in the coming months. Key insights from the event include: The customer/supplier relationship between CCGs and CSUs should be actively explored and tested in the workplace, until an acceptable balance is achieved which produces the best results for both parties.

This requires sophisticated relationships, processes and leadership behaviours in order to succeed, and this is as much a requirement for CSUs as CCGs, as they develop their organisational forms and function. The clinical leader\u2019s role needs to be well supported by other commissioning team members and their expertise recognised and used effectively. Existing arrangements for working together will benefit from being formalised, reviewed and monitored in the future. CCGs should be able to draw on the proposed framework for collaborative commissioning. Similar rigour will be required in determining and monitoring commissioning support arrangements. The Board Authority is using the insights from the report to inform its approach to CCG and commissioning support development over the coming months, and is providing a programme of targeted, practical support to CCGs and CSUs including: Guidance for CCGs and CSUs on collaborative commissioning arrangements. Guidance for CCGs on procuring clinical services. Exploring with CCGs the potential procurement options for buying commissioning support. The draft mandate for the NHS Commissioning Board \u2013 Our NHS Care Objectives , which is currently being consulted upon \u2013 outlines that the NHSCB will need to set up a new procurement framework to enable CCGs to procure from providers. A market development group that includes representatives from local authorities and the independent sector to develop a long term market development strategy for commissioning support. As part of this workstream, there will be a series of \u2018market days\u2019 for CCGs in autumn 2012 to support CCGs to become more informed customers of commissioning support and to aid their understanding of a range of potential suppliers in the future. News in brief The first round of appointments to local area team director posts has been made by the NHS Commissioning Board Authority. The first 16 of the 25 directors have been appointed. More information about these appointments here . The NHS Commissioning Board Authority and Local Government Association are organising a joint conference aimed at NHS commissioners and providers and local authority colleagues. \u2018Integrated Commissioning for Better Health and Care\u2019 will take place in London on 29 October 2012. The conference will promote examples of shared learning around integrated services, system leadership, joint planning and sector led improvement and innovation. Confirmed speakers to date are: Sir David Nicholson CBE, Chief Executive, NHS Commissioning Board Authority and Councillor Sir Merrick Cockell, Chairman, LGA. It is free to NHS colleagues. More details about the conference . The latest Bulletin for proposed CCGs is available on the NHS Commissioning Board Authority\u2019s website. All the bulletins can be seen here .

      "content": "National Director: Commissioning Development Dame Barbara Hakin has provided an update on the hosting charge which the NHS Commissioning Board (NHS CB) will require commissioning support units (CSUs) to pay. She said the NHS CB is hoping to agree a charge that is less than the 50p per head figure that the NHS Commissioning Board Authority had originally asked CSUs to use in their planning assumptions for 2013-14. The hosting charge will cover the costs of the CSU Transition Team at the NHS CB \u2013 and its work to assure, develop and externalise CSUs \u2013 and costs which the NHS CB will incur to act as employer and host and to provide infrastructure to the 23 CSUs, such as HR, payroll, audit, IT, estates and legal services. The Board Authority is currently developing the hosting arrangements which will be put in place between the NHS CB and CSUs. It is setting up a series of working groups \u2013 across areas such as HR, informatics, intellectual property and estates \u2013 to explore the governance arrangements and contribute to this developing work. The Board Authority has also awarded a contract to Price Waterhouse Coopers which will help it to explore and appraise the potential externalisation options. This will be part of the work of the Commissioning Support Strategy and Market Development Team. CSUs are likely to be granted a licence to operate by the NHS CB in the autumn. This will define the relationship between CSUs and the NHS CB, including the freedoms and delegated powers granted by the NHS CB to each CSU. CSUs with a higher risk profile will have greater levels of intervention than those with a lower level of risk. CSUs will have governance arrangements equivalent to a board, including individuals who can act in a \u2018non-executive\u2019 type role, but will not be able legally to call these arrangements a board. This is because CSUs are not yet organisations, but part of the NHS CB and consequently part of its governance arrangements. Following the announcement of the appointment of the 16 th CSU managing director on 15 August, further appointments are expected in early September. For a number of CSUs where there are strong interim arrangements, it may be that substantive appointments will be made later in the year. Share: Tweet",

      "content": "Starting with the NHS Commissioning Board Authority CCG Lay Assessors. A new dawn is breaking in the NHS, bringing with it a new relationship between citizens, their health and their NHS. It is a relationship of collaboration, transparency and openness. The NHS Commissioning Board Authority is committed to leading by example. It has begun by opening up the clinical commissioning group (CCG) authorisation process to give public and patient voices the opportunity to work collaboratively with professionals, shaping the future of our NHS together. In July, the NHS Commissioning Board Authority placed its first advertisements for Lay Assessors to become part of the CCG Authorisation Panels. In just 3 working days we received more than 500 enquiries and more than 300 applicants. It wasn\u2019t just the numbers that were incredible, but the depth and spread of the applications, from all corners of the country and beyond, we even had one query from Australia! This tremendous response was down to two really important factors: the passion and commitment which people feel for the health of their community and for the NHS, and the fantastic supporting networks we have in this country working with so many different communities. We have felt genuinely privileged and touched by the stories people from all walks of life have shared with us, and amazed by the level of the energy and effort people are already voluntarily giving towards improving the health and wellbeing of others. We have now completed the near-impossible job of shortlisting for the first cohort of NHS Commissioning Board Lay Assessors. As the pioneers, these people will not just help us with the first wave of CCG Authorisation, but will also help the Board to improve how we recruit, train and support Lay Assessors and contribute to the strengthening of the patient and public voice across the work of the Board . This first cohort of people came from a huge range of backgrounds, from an international lawyer to a former Royal Navy Commander to a man who lives with a mental health condition and is a spokesperson for the charity Rethink. What unites them all is their passion and commitment to public involvement in health services. We have no doubt that they will all make a fantastic contribution to shaping the future of health in this country through work with the Board, and we look forward to them sharing their experiences, ideas and insights with us all. The New CCG Lay Assessors have kindly agreed to allow us to share with you why they stepped forward for this role. I believe service users and carers play a vital role in helping commissioners determine what services are provided locally and that it is essential that the newly formed CCGs adequately address the views of service users and their carers. I would therefore greatly value being part of the process of determining that CCGs have the ability to appropriately commission services and respond to local healthcare needs and aspirations. I want to ensure that the patient voice is clearly heard in the new commissioning structure and that it becomes firmly embedded in the commissioning process. I strongly believe in the NHS and want to see patient involvement in its developmental process across the board I am passionate about having a successful NHS which treats people holistically covering both physical and mental healthcare and provides access and treatment to all individuals regardless of background and diversity and can understand impact of delays in treatment to people\u2019s lives I want to put my experience to use and make sure that future generations get the same good service that I have had. I have had a long-term condition for a long time but have had a full life. I have a strong belief that Lay Assessors have a more impartial and objective view of the services than professional bodies, as they are not bound by the restrictions or limitations of an institution. Lay Assessors have less bureaucratic perspective and a friendly fresh approach that is innovative and valuable. Lay Assessors often have personal experience that enables them to have an empathy with the person or situation. Thank you to all who have contributed to this work so far A heartfelt thank you to everyone who took the time to complete an application and every person and organisation who passed on the information to those in their networks, including the Richmond Group, the NHS Alliance, the DH Strategic Partners, Altogether Better, the NHS Public and Patient Engagement Leads, the LINKS/Healthwatch networks and our online communities especially Twitter users. We look forward to developing new and stronger existing relationships and networks over the coming months in the shared pursuit of creating a new powerful relationship between active citizens and the NHS CB.

I\u2019m going to be quite brief this issue as I know many people are enjoying a well-earned break at the moment. However, while we may be attending fewer meetings at this time of year, there is still plenty of work going on across the country. The authorisation process for Wave 1 CCGs is continuing with planning for the site visits well underway. The visits are a crucial element of the process and provide a formal opportunity for representatives from the NHS Commissioning Board to meet and assess the CCG leadership team within their local environment. All 35 visits will take place in September. Meanwhile, we\u2019re also looking forward to receiving the authorisation applications from Wave 2 CCGs in the next few days, and if your group is in that wave I hope you\u2019re taking advantage of all the resources and information on the NHS CBA website and on the authorisation portal to help you navigate the course. One thing I would like to draw your attention to is the NHS Commissioning Assembly, which we mentioned in issue 16 of the bulletin at the beginning of July. CCG clinical leads will already have received a letter from Sir David Nicholson setting out the ideas and principles behind the Assembly and I will shortly be writing out to you again with more details about the launch event. For now, please just put the date of 14 November in your diaries. Finally, if you would like to get involved in the wider transition of the health and care system there are plenty of opportunities to have your say on a variety of different aspects at the moment. A number of consultations are currently taking place across the system and your views are essential if you want the voice of clinical commissioners to be heard. In the bulletin below you\u2019ll see there are chances to comment on the role of Monitor, how local Healthwatch will operate, and of course on the draft mandate between the Department of Health and the Commissioning Board. Please do take the opportunity to contribute and shape the way we will work in the future. Thank you for your continued enthusiasm, commitment and hard work as we move towards the new commissioning system. If you would like to let me know about your own local progress, or have any comments, questions or feedback about the commissioning development programme, please do get in touch. You can contact me via pathfinderlearningnetwork@nhs.net . Dame Barbara Hakin National Director for Commissioning Development New leadership arrangements through transition NHS Chief Executive, David Nicholson, has written to NHS leaders this month to set out the next stage in the transition to the new health and care system. In the letters he describes arrangements to ensure stability and resilience for the current system through transition to the new health and care system from April 2013. This means that people appointed to regional and local leadership roles in the NHS Commissioning Board (NHS CB) will take on responsibility both for the teams managing operational delivery in 2012/13 and planning the new system for 2013/14. Leaders working in this way will be accountable to the NHS CB for future planning and development; and be accountable to the PCTs / SHAs for relevant delivery and performance in the current system. The arrangements should be in place from 1 October 2012 and will not impact on CCGs as they prepare for their key roles in the new health and care system. For more information and to read the letters visit the Department of Health website. CCG leaders needed to join Leadership Programme Board The new NHS Leadership Academy is looking for two senior CCG members to be part of its Programme Board. The Board\u2019s role and duties will include: informing and endorsing the Academy\u2019s strategy; shaping a positive culture; providing a strategic view on leadership development; engaging with stakeholders and opinion formers; and championing the Academy. The Board will meet quarterly and the first meeting is on Wednesday 26 September in Leeds. Go to www.leadershipacademy.nhs.uk to find out more. If you are interested please email Lisa Radoje at lisa.radoje@dh.gsi.gov.uk by Wednesday 5 September. CCG authorisation: Additional clinical panellist to join site visits Shortly after the publication of CCG authorisation: Draft guide for assessors participating in site visits , the NHS CB agreed plans to strengthen the proposed site visit panel composition. Therefore, there will now be an additional clinical panellist present at site visits who will focus specifically on the quality agenda \u2013 including safety and the extent to which quality assurance, monitoring and improvement is reflected in the applications for authorisation. The Chief Nursing Officer and colleagues from the four SHA clusters are currently finalising nominations for this additional clinical representation and these additional panellists will be subject to the same robust training that all other panellists attend prior to site visits. Although this additional clinical representative will focus specifically on quality, all panellists will refer to the evidence against all criteria \u2013 including those related to quality \u2013 as the basis for their assessment to ensure rigour and consistency. The authorisation process takes a holistic approach to ensuring that CCGs, as locally clinically-led commissioners, have sufficiently high levels of capability, systems and process in quality assurance, monitoring and improvement to be authorised as statutory bodies and to function effectively as commissioning organisations. If you have any questions related to this or anything about site visits, please take a look at the updated authorisation FAQs or email ccg.mailbox@nhs.net . CCG authorisation: Training videos for assessors The NHS Commissioning Board Authority is currently training NHS assessors and panellists to undertake the desktop review and site visits of CCGs as part of the authorisation process. In order to make sure as many people as possible understand how the process is being carried out a series of training videos has been produced. They will not only help the assessors, but may also give CCGs a better idea of what to expect during the process. The three videos have been designed to communicate the purpose, principles and practices of the overall CCG authorisation process, the desktop review stage and the panellist site visits. The videos are available here . GP informatics More detail has been agreed on the future of GP and primary care informatics in the new health and care system. The NHS Commissioning Board (NHS CB) will be accountable for the delivery of primary care IT in the future, with funding and responsibility for GP IT (ie the provision of clinical systems; associated hardware and network services; and support services \u2013 including training \u2013 to GP practices) being delegated to CCGs. Responsibility for other primary care IT systems (ie for dentistry or ophthalmology) will be managed through the NHS CB\u2019s local area teams. CCGs as commissioners will need to own a locality informatics strategy as part of their role in driving forward transformation of services. Clinical systems and their provision are a vital part of this and important enablers in ensuring primary care quality and innovation. Work is still ongoing with PCTs to determine the level of current spend on GP IT, after which decisions will be taken to agree the allocation of funds to CCGs in 2013/14. This will be communicated once the figures have been agreed. Meanwhile, the Local Service Provider (LSP) contract and GP Systems of Choice (GPSoC) \u2013 the programme which enables practices to choose their GP IT system \u2013 will continue to be managed and funded at a national level. CCGs however will be expected to provide appropriate support and training to their practices where they have made a choice to switch to an alternative system. If you have any questions about the informatics programme please contact ccgdevelopment@nhs.net . National Quality Board report The National Quality Board (NQB) has this month published a report setting out how quality will be maintained and improved in the new health system. The NQB brings together the national organisations across the health system responsible for quality including the Care Quality Commission, Monitor, the NHS Trust Development Authority, NICE, the General Medial Council, the Nursing and Midwifery Council, the NHS Commissioning Board Authority and the Department of Health. This report, focuses predominantly on how the new system should prevent, identify and respond to serious failures in quality and provides a collective statement from NQB members about: the nature and place of quality in the new health system; the distinct roles and responsibilities for quality of the different parts of the system; how the different parts of the system should work together to share information and intelligence on quality and to ensure an aligned and coordinated system wide response in the event of a quality failure; and the values and behaviours that all parts of the system will need to display in order to put the interests of patients and the public first and ahead of organisational interests. CCG commissioners should ensure that they understand their roles and responsibilities in relation to quality. They are responsible for commissioning care of a sufficient quality and for monitoring the quality of care being provided through their contracts with their providers. They will be crucial members of the new quality surveillance groups and will need to work with regulators and other organisations in a culture of open and honest cooperation. The report is in draft form, and the NQB would welcome views on the approach it describes from those working in or with an interest in the health system. Please send any views to nationalqualityboard@dh.gsi.gov.uk by 30 September 2012. Local Healthwatch regulations The Government is currently seeking views from proposed CCGs, and other stakeholders, on proposals for local Healthwatch. Healthwatch will be the new consumer champion for both health and social care. It will exist in two distinct forms \u2013 local Healthwatch, at local level, and Healthwatch England, at national level. Local Healthwatch will replace Local Involvement Networks (LINks), carrying forward the LINks functions while taking on new, additional functions. CCGs are now being asked to have their say on: the proposed regulations on how commissioners should respond to requests, reports and recommendations made by Local Healthwatch the proposed regulations on the duty on providers to allow representatives of Local Healthwatch or their contractors, to enter premises to observe the nature and quality of services. This letter provides further information and all consultation responses should be sent by Friday 14 September 2012. Draft mandate consultation The consultation on the draft mandate for the NHS Commissioning Board Our NHS Care Objectives continues until 26 September. One of the core five sections is on effective commissioning. This sets out a small number of objectives about the way that the Board introduces the new commissioning system to help achieve the full benefits of clinically-led commissioning, while at the same time managing the transition in a way that safeguards service performance and finances. Read more information and have your say . Monitor consultations Earlier this month the Department of Health (DH) published detailed proposals for consultation on sector regulation and the new role of Monitor, who will regulate all providers of NHS services in the future in order to protect patient\u2019s interests. The consultations, which are likely to be of particular interest to clinical commissioners, cover the following areas: Licensing organisations providing NHS services, including: Who will be required to hold a licence? How can providers challenge proposed changes to licence conditions? What is the maximum fine that Monitor could impose for breach of licence conditions? Procurement, patient choice and competition regulations for commissioners, which: sets out proposals for minimum requirements in relation to procurement, choice and competition seeks views on whether the safeguards are enough to protect the interests of patients, or if any additional requirements are needed. You can find out more about the proposals on sector regulation and participate in the consultations here . Alongside the DH consultations, Monitor is also consulting on guidance for commissioners on continuity of essential services and on its draft licence conditions for providers. Monitor\u2019s consultation documents, alongside details of bespoke workshops for CCGs, can be downloaded from its website . Integrated commissioning conference, 29 October The NHS Commissioning Board Authority (NHS CBA) and the Local Government Association (LGA) are organising a joint conference aimed at NHS commissioners, providers and local authority colleagues. Integrated Commissioning for Better Health and Care will take place in London on Monday 29 October 2012. The conference will promote examples of shared learning around integrated services, system leadership, joint planning and sector led improvement and innovation. It will highlight the opportunities that exist to commission services in a more integrated way with emerging partners. It will also outline how the NHS and local government plan to work together at a national level to support local commissioners and will seek the views of attendees about what support would be helpful at a local level to promote integration. Confirmed speakers to date are: Sir David Nicholson, Chief Executive, NHS CBA Councillor Sir Merrick Cockell, Chairman, LGA The event is free to NHS colleagues. Click here for more details . Innovation health and wealth: Publication of formularies Sir David Nicholson has written to CCG leaders, along with SHA and PCT chief executives, to ask them to lead the way in reducing variation in patient access to NICE recommended medicines and technologies. In the letter he highlights the importance of formularies and their role in underpinning the safe and effective use of medicines. He is now asking all NHS organisations, including CCGs, to publish information on which NICE Technology Appraisals are included in their local formularies by 1 April 2013. Publication will also be a standard term and condition in NHS contracts from the same date. Read the full letter here . News in brief Authorisation FAQs An updated version of the frequently asked questions (FAQs) on authorisation has now been published on the NHS CBA website Authorisation CS supplement CCG authorisation: Supplement for assessors reviewing CCG commissioning support arrangements has been published on the NHS CBA website. The document has been produced for CCG authorisation assessors and particularly looks at the tests that will be applied for those CCGs that are providing their commissioning support functions \u2018in house\u2019. Commissioning support hosting Initial information about the hosting charge which the NHS CB will require commissioning support units to pay has been announced . The hosting charge will cover the costs of the CSU transition team at the NHS CB and its work to assure, develop and externalise CSUs, plus costs which the NHS CB will incur to act as employer and host and to provide infrastructure. Commissioning support bulletin The latest issue of the commissioning support bulletin has been published online . It includes news about \u2018scale\u2019 services; naming conventions of commissioning support units (CSUs); checkpoint 3; and the start of the process to appoint CSU finance directors.

      "content": "If you have not been bitten by the Olympics bug, and therefore are not waiting in nervous anticipation for the Paralympics to alleviate your withdrawal symptoms, then you might like to look away now\u2026. Throughout London 2012 there have been high quality performances, both on and off the various fields of play, that have taken our breath away. Events that had previously gone unappreciated have burst in to our homes through a plethora of media channels. My unexpected guilty pleasure was the team rhythmic gymnastics (don\u2019t knock it until you\u2019ve seen it!) \u2013 oh to have that sort of handover in healthcare! So in the hiatus between Games it was timely that the road to quality returned to take pride of place at the NHSCB Future Design Group. The opening conundrum focused on the observation that whilst the evidence is clear that improvements in quality are more likely to occur when formal improvement methodologies are adopted, these methodologies are failing to connect with frontline clinicians, or vice-versa. Throughout London 2012 we have been presented with back stories of successful athletes that repeatedly demonstrate behind every great team performance sits great leadership, methodology, sacrifice, drive and commitment. So who will be responsible for quality improvement in the new NHS? With the Francis report just round the corner and the National Quality Board draft report hot off the press this is going to be the source of much debate in coming months. In reality it is less about who is responsible and more about what are we each responsible for. Today we were focusing on the NHSCB as a system leader and a commissioner. So what needs to change? If we are to get best value for the population we serve then bold leadership from NHSCB, in partnership with CCGs, around the totality of quality rather than individual elements or isolated perceptions will be an important step in delivering improved population focused outcomes. The style of that leadership will need to be different from the dominant pacesetting style of the past and one that enables each part of the NHS, and each individual within the NHS, to be more effective. During London 2012 the British Track Cycling Team was perhaps the pinnacle of such a team approach. No \u201cMagic\u201d wheels but a 1% improvement in a large enough number of areas to deliver the highest levels of performance at just the right time. Each member of that team united around a common purpose, clear about exactly what their role was and fully equipped to deliver it in a self-directed way. A key part of Team Quality in the NHS will be the Care Quality Commission (CQC) overseeing essential quality standards for registered providers through its regulation framework whilst NHSCB and CCGs will be able to drive performance through contractual mechanisms. In a quality improvement environment today\u2019s improvement is tomorrow\u2019s registration standard so close team working between these organisations will be pivotal to sustaining improvements in quality. At present it is less than clear as to how this will work. One key area of collaboration will be around common quality measures. During London 2012 success has been measured on a number of different outcomes: gold medals, silver medals, bronze medals, world records, Olympic games records, national records, personal bests, season bests, doing your best (especially if you were in team GB and being cheered on by the home crowd \u2013 or was that collusion?). However, measuring team success seems slightly more difficult to reach agreement on. So whilst most of the world\u2019s medal tables are based on the number of gold medals won, in which Team GB came third, the U.S. adopted a table based on total medals won, in which Team GB came 4th. Team Canada finished 36th or 13th respectively depending on the measure of success used. Team Grenada looked best in the gold medals per head of population at about 1 per 100,000 but finished 50th and 85th respectively by the other measures. Getting the quality measure right really counts. Without wishing to stretch this analogy too far does this then raise the question of how should the NHS measure its success around value? By the end of London 2012 the media stories started to move towards the enduring legacy and future investment in both elite and grass roots sports. It soon became clear that behind much of the success also sits investment. Investment in elite athletes delivers more success and success breeds more elite athletes in that sport. Investment in grass roots sport gives opportunity to more future elite athletes. Elite sport funding investment decisions are made after each Olympic Games ahead of the next. There is a finite amount of money to be distributed amongst an increasing number of causes all competing to be given a chance to compete at the highest level. Some sports will receive large sums of investment and others none, based on their performance and likelihood of delivering medals in the future. So should success in the NHS be based on the number of gold standard services it has (where bronze still represents significant success rather than failure) or on a total count of quality and therefore value across the whole population? What represents better value within the NHS? It is investing to deliver the equivalent of 29 golds, 17 silvers and 19 bronze medals or investing to delivering 65 or more silvers\u2026\u2026and does it even work like that? As well as the medal counts the information on each athlete\u2019s performance is readily available in an intelligible comparable format and subject to detailed analysis. As commissioners of healthcare having the same detail of information on provider performance would be a far cry from our current experience and watching Team GB\u2019s track cycling team pouring over the data from each race to maximise performance in the next served to illustrate how important information and methodology can be. Armed with the right information commissioners would be better placed to identify areas of genuine underperformance and target their efforts in challenging and supporting quality improvement in specific elements of the supply chain. Although not everything we value is easy to measure. I really enjoyed Team GBs success in the dressage but its scoring looked quite subjective to me! I will leave the final, if slightly modified in italics, prophetic word to providers on quality improvement in the NHS to Dave Brailsford CBE, performance director of British Cycling, \u201c The NHS Commissioning Board has delivered and there can be no excuses now. There are not many nations in the world that have the same backing. It\u2019s scary because all the obstacles have been removed and there is nothing for us to hide behind.\u201d Comments on this page are now closed. Share: Tweet",

      "content": "The energy and enthusiasm at last week\u2019s NHS Innovation Expo was striking \u2013 lots of people wanting to exploit the potential of better digital and technology delivery to improve services to patients, to support new ways of providing care, to help save time and money to be spent on those most in need. With the NHS handling over 1 million patients every 36 hours, there is a real opportunity to improve people\u2019s lives. How are we doing when it comes to our digital services? 49% of UK adults access health information online and NHS Choices receives about 27 million unique visits every month. But dig deeper and you find information and services are often not joined up across a host of \u2013 around 3000 \u2013 NHS sites, many services could be improved and many things can\u2019t be done online at all, such as (universally) registering with a GP. The last NHS patient survey found only 10.1% of patients ordering repeat prescriptions online and only 6.4% booking GP appointments. With 86% of adults using the internet, we could do a lot more to provide information and services that are simpler, clearer, better. The National Information Board \u2013 which sets technology strategy for health and care\u2013 has recognised this, putting an improved central online offer, NHS.UK, at the heart of its plans for better patient facing services. If there\u2019s one challenge above all \u2013 we need to deliver excellent online services by designing them for the people who use them rather than around the way we are structured. Digital services can cross organisation boundaries \u2013 whether local or national or health or social care. Jeremy Hunt has talked about a \u201cpatient-centric\u201d and \u201cmore human\u201d system. We should certainly be that online. That\u2019s where we come in. NHS England and the Department of Health have formed a small cross-system team to develop the vision for NHS.UK. It includes expertise from our own organisations, from the NHS Choices team at the Health and Social Care Information Centre, as well as people who have delivered excellent digital services in the Government Digital Service and elsewhere. We\u2019ve set up on the top floor of Wellington House in Waterloo. Over the next 12 weeks\u2026 We will be mapping out how people find dealing with the health and care system in a number of condition areas. We\u2019ll be talking to them and to front line staff about their needs. And we will be using that to identify opportunities for improved online information and services. We will prototype possible solutions and develop them further based on feedback from users. We\u2019ll be pulling together a detailed plan for how we could realise those prototypes \u2013 and the next phase of NHS.UK overall \u2013 in practice. And we\u2019ll set a plan on standards and guidance to help other teams to build great digital services on NHS.UK. A 12 week project isn\u2019t going to solve all the digital delivery challenges facing the health and care system. This is about setting a clear vision for NHS.UK, with prototypes that demonstrate the opportunities and a plan that gets us to the next stage. It\u2019s also \u2013 to be frank \u2013 about increasing understanding of and confidence in a more \u201cdigital\u201d, more agile, more user led approach in health and care. After the 12 weeks, we will be doing more work to learn and consult. In how we\u2019ve set up, we\u2019ve tried to learn lessons from digital transformation projects across health and care and other public services. Common themes are \u2013 a team that works across different organisational silos and includes real expertise in digital delivery, policy and health and social care; an approach that is relentlessly led by user needs, both \u2018end-users\u2019 and health professionals, not by current constraints; the need to involve clinical experts throughout; and a clear governance structure and senior leadership. One thing we\u2019ve also learned over the last few weeks is just how many people are committed to improving digital health and care and want to help. That\u2019s why we\u2019ll be communicating about the project in the open, learning from colleagues and sharing what we\u2019re finding. We\u2019ll be speaking with lots of people, we\u2019ll have a dedicated blog (you\u2019re on it!) and we\u2019ll be inviting a number of people to our team show and tells. We\u2019ll also be tweeting using the hashtag #NHSalpha . Please do wish us luck, and feel free to follow our work and share your own learnings \u2013 either by commenting below or emailing us . Helen Rowntree Head of Digital Services, NHS England Adam Bye Deputy Director (Digital), Department of Health Comment 11 comments Comment from Alan Grey September 10th 2015 at 12:46 pm You mention a clear governance structure and leadership, but I really don\u2019t understand who owns the content on NHS.UK. The legal notices point to the Department of Health NHS choices team, which does not exist. You may think this is a constraint, but this sort of muddled thinking led to NHS England not being given the legal powers to do it\u2019s job. We need the boring legal stuff to be clearer, simpler and better as well. Reply Comment from John Hodges September 10th 2015 at 2:02 pm Hi An excellent initiative and great to see so much energy. Here at Skyscape we ready to provide the secure N3 connected cloud infrastructure you\u2019ll need for these new initiatives. We already provide the cloud hosting for the Genomes programme.

It is great to see the work for NHS.UK starting off on such a positive and driven format and I\u2019d love to be able to volunteer another pair of eyes, ears and hands. Reply Comment from Twoshedzz September 14th 2015 at 8:24 am Good Luck Helen! A rebirth of nhs.uk has been a long time coming, so I\u2019m looking forward to seeing what emerges. Alpha phase can be a lot of fun but also a real challenge to keep focused, especially something of this scale. Reply Comment from Adam Bye September 14th 2015 at 12:09 pm Thank you for all your supportive comments so far, both here and on social media. Andy, please do drop us an email at the address above, setting out what you\u2019ve got in mind (we may of course have to ration interest depending on how much we get!). Alan, agree we should avoid muddle as much as we can \u2013 we\u2019re also pointing out your observation to the Choices team. Reply Comment from Kate Green September 14th 2015 at 3:47 pm Have you got any patients in your design team / user group to help define content and lots of them doing user testing? Reply Comment from Mark Duman September 15th 2015 at 8:02 pm Suggest including GOV.UK, http://www.pifonline.org.uk and (CQC) Public Involvement Forum in your conversations? Reply Comment from Adam Bye September 17th 2015 at 4:34 pm Thank you Mark and Kate. We very much agree on the importance of involving patients throughout this work \u2013 including through existing forums \u2013 and of extensive user testing. We intend to do both. We\u2019ve also been working closely with the GDS team (and indeed have some of their alumni with us). Reply Comment from Paul September 21st 2015 at 10:51 am I strongly feel there is a lot of opportunity for the NHS to leverage digital as a means of driving awareness of initiatives, at a local and national level, that in turn will drive efficiency, and most importantly save lives. Reply Comment from Tony Shannon September 22nd 2015 at 3:44 pm Hi Adam, Good to see you at NHSExpo recently. We\u2019re very interested and encouraged by your DH/NHS UX plans and keen to see how to play it into our RippleOSI platform development. FYI our website is at rippleosi.org We are building on other Clinical UI Pattern work we have done before.. clinuip.wordpress.com We\u2019re using http://www.invisionapp.com/ as our prototyping tool and then coding the preferred UX. You can see the latest version of our IDCR demonstrator here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFuhOV42W8I FYI some great work out of the US based on a challenge fund healthdesignchallenge.com The NHS Common User Interface work was very good in its own right, but component based , with no regard to an overarching UI framework. http://systems.hscic.gov.uk/data/cui Both great pieces of work but impact unfortunately limited as 1) not proven in a reference application & 2) not open sourced So on healthcare IT usability is acknowledged to need much improvement. Done properly high quality UX work could be transformative in the NHS.. Yet that demands that the outputs are coded and open sourced..or I fear are likely to stay on a shelf. Hopefully we can find some good common ground to effectively collaborate on this.. thanks again, Tony Dr. Tony Shannon Director, Ripple Community rippleosi.org Reply Leave a comment Click here to cancel reply.

      "content": "You\u2019ll have seen from Adam and Helen\u2019s blog post that we\u2019ve started up NHS.UK Alpha to develop the vision for NHS.UK. I\u2019m Dan Sheldon, Digital Strategy Lead for the Department of Health and part of the multidisciplinary team behind the NHS.UK Alpha. You can read more about us here . We have an incredibly exciting opportunity to make things simpler for users and better for health and care professionals by bringing health and care into the Internet age . This post will hopefully give a sense of some of the issues we\u2019re grappling with as we are thinking about the future of NHS.UK. We\u2019ll be posting more in detail about our approach over the coming days. Healthcare is massive The first thing that has struck us is the size and complexity of health and care in England. Health and care is a service, a system, an economy and a sector \u2013 all at once. The NHS is \u2013 as fans of trivia will know \u2013 the fifth largest employer in the world. But in reality, the NHS in England is not a single organisation that acts as one. There are actually over 9,000 separate organisations involved in providing or commissioning NHS care, according to the NHS Confederation . And that doesn\u2019t even include social care, pharmacies and dental surgeries. (For comparison, central government has just 497 constituent organisations .) As @alexandtheweb and @thatdavidmiller put it on Twitter the other day: @alexandtheweb @blangry There are deep structural barriers, and the fragmentation is almost fractaly endless ! \u2014 David Miller (@thatdavidmiller) September 18, 2015 Some of the statistics are mind boggling. Over 1.3m NHS staff . 6.5m carers . An annual NHS budget of \u00a3113bn. We already know that digital transformation in such a large, federated environment is difficult. We also need to understand how NHS.UK can help the public navigate the health and care system. Deciding where to start Our task is to set the vision for NHS.UK. There\u2019s plenty of ways to tackle this \u2013 we have some choices to make about where to start. An obvious place to start would be to improve how information is published by health and care organisations on the web. As Adam and Helen mentioned , there are over 3,000 live health and care websites on the nhs.uk domain, as well as some on gov.uk and other domains. We also have NHS Choices , a rich source of health information with over 20,000 pieces of content. Alternatively, we could focus on service transformation. As the recent NIB 2020 framework \u2013 the vision for technology and data published by the National Information Board \u2013 stated: \u201cThe consumer experience of care services remains much as it was before the mobile phone and the internet became commonplace.\u201d Surely it is time that many basic transactions in health and care like registering with a GP were available online. Getting this right will be key to making things better for users and saving the NHS money in the process. But redesigning each service in health from scratch will take a long time. With central government focusing on platforms , perhaps we should be trying to understand health-as-a-platform : fixing common problems like identity and booking once, rather than expecting each digital service to invent its own solution. Over the past few weeks we have been exploring and prototyping opportunities to make things better across all three \u2013 information, services and platforms. We\u2019ll be writing about this soon \u2013 keep an eye on this blog over the coming days. Where NHS.UK could help We\u2019ve also been looking at the major challenges facing the the health and care sector and asking how NHS.UK could help solve them. Last year\u2019s Five Year Forward View called for action on three fronts to protect the future of the NHS: demand, funding and efficiency. This will require a step change change in our approach to public health and prevention, action on safety and quality, empowering patients to take control of their own care and increased transparency of performance . And we\u2019re going to have to get smarter about how we spend money, driving efficiencies to get better for less. We are also seeing changes to how care is delivered, with the traditional divides dissolving between \u201cfamily doctors and hospitals, between physical and mental health, between health and social care, between prevention and treatment\u201d . And we\u2019re also seeing a shift away from a world where health services are reactive, discrete events that take place in hospitals and surgeries. The future of care is continuing, preventative, proactive and personalised. This is what \u2018 new models of care \u2019 means in practice. Running through these reforms is the idea, promoted by our minister Jeremy Hunt in a recent speech, of making healthcare less system centred and more human centred . Our task is to use service design to build an NHS.UK that reduces the complexity of modern-day healthcare for everyone. There are also loud calls for action on specific conditions and diseases. To take one high profile example, each year 24,000 with diabetes in the UK die early, according to DiabetesUK . Treating the 3.8m people with diabetes accounts for around \u00a310bn of NHS spend each year, most of which is spent dealing with complications like heart disease and stroke. So, how can NHS.UK be designed to meet the needs of those with particular conditions, and their carers? While we need to understand the commonalities and the \u2018retail\u2019 aspects of healthcare \u2013 appointments, medicines, observations \u2013 there is no one-size-fits all solution. Healthcare isn\u2019t a transaction. If we focus too much on individual diseases and conditions, we risk losing sight of the totality of a care for an individual. People don\u2019t fit neatly into boxes marked \u2018diabetes\u2019 or \u2018dementia\u2019, not least those with multiple conditions. We need to be human-centred, not disease-centred in how we design NHS.UK. And of course, there have been many years of hard work realising the benefits of technology in health and care. Electronic records done right have improved safety and efficiency; advances in medical technologies have improved millions of lives. Technology has also raised challenges of its own: how is personal data being protected ? When should data be shared between organisations? Even if we agree it should, how do we get different systems (often without open standards and APIs) to talk the same language ? And what about the impact of online referrals and appointments on working practices in the NHS? We also have a major task ahead to win the trust of patients, carers and health and care professionals . For the public, we need to meet their ever increasing service expectations and ensure we handle personal data in a way that is safe, transparent and consensual . For health and care professionals, we need to build credibility and deliver for them. We know that we need to work hard to understand the needs of our users, whether professionals or members of the public. We need to make sure we\u2019re actually making things better, rather than just making things digital. These two things are not the same. Learning from others The original idea for NHS.UK Alpha was compelling simple: that we needed to move from talking about the future of NHS.UK to doing . Instead of writing strategies and drawing diagrams \u2013 we\u2019ve done that \u2013 we are building prototypes, testing in public and learning. Show the thing. We owe a debt to alphagov for the inspiration to start in this way. But even this, to some extent, has been done before. Some committed, talented people have tried to do come up with a vision for what has been variously called an \u2018integrated national information and advice service\u2019, a \u2018front door\u2019, an \u2018online portal\u2019 and a \u2018customer service platform\u2019 for health and care. Many of them even built prototypes to bring the vision to life. What we have lacked are the clear plans to turn these into a reality. So alongside the work we\u2019re doing to understand user needs, build prototypes and articulate the vision, we will be pulling together that plan for how we can realise NHS.UK in practice. It\u2019s not complicated, it\u2019s just hard In this post, I\u2019ve tried to give a sense of the backdrop of challenges and opportunities to our work in the NHS.UK Alpha. We\u2019re trying to work out where we think NHS.UK can help. But we\u2019re not splitting the atom. We\u2019re putting things online and making things simpler for users. There are patterns for this \u2013 health and care is well behind other sectors. Every day, professionals in the NHS are solving more complex problems than this one. However, change is hard. Realising an NHS.UK that works for everyone will take time and a huge collaborative effort. We\u2019ll need help and support from experts from across health and care and beyond.

We want as many people as possible to be able to use our website, and we have designed it to be accessible. Page contents How you can use this website On this website, you should be able to: change colours, contrast levels, and fonts zoom in up to 300% with text staying visible on the screen, and most images scaling without resolution loss navigate most of the website using a keyboard navigate most of the website using speech recognition software read most of the website using a screen reader, including the latest versions of JAWS, NVDA, and VoiceOver read most of the website on devices without a screen, like a braille computer use the website even if Javascript is switched off We've made the website text as simple as possible to understand, aiming for a reading age of a 12 year old. Some of our content is technical, and we use technical terms where there is no easier wording we could use without changing what the text means. If you have a disability then AbilityNet has advice to help you make your device easier to use . How accessible this website is The majority of this website is fully accessible, and we run weekly audits to identify any new problems. We know that some parts of the website aren't fully accessible: we have a large number of old publication documents which are in PDF format, and haven't been designed for accessibility some content is embedded in our website, such as maps and videos, and you cannot easily scale these on screen (but you can open a full screen version) data visualisation tools in the website currently use inaccessible technologies such as PowerBI and Tableau How to get information in an accessible format If you have problems accessing information on this website, or would like any of our work in a different format like a more accessible PDF, large print, easy read, audio recording, or braille: email enquiries@nhsdigital.nhs.uk telephone us on 0300 303 5678 We'll consider your request, and aim to get back to you within 3 days. Reporting accessibility problems We're always looking to improve the accessibilty of the website. If you find any problems which aren't listed on this page, or think that we're not meeting the requirements of the accessiblity regulations then please email web@nhs.net to let us know. Enforcement procedure The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the accessibility regulations. If you\u2019re not happy with how we respond to your complaint, contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS) . Technical information about this website's accessibility The Health and Social Care Information Centre is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 . This website is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below. Issues with technology The vast majority of our website works correctly on any web technology. For security reasons, we only support TLS 1.2 and higher security protocols, and this means that some older browsers will not show the site. How our site looks and work is based on HTML5, and we test for and support the following browsers: Google Chrome (versions in support) Mozilla Firefox (versions in support) Microsoft Internet Explorer (version 11 only) Microsoft Edge (versions in support) Apple Safari (versions in support) We also test in the Lynx browser to ensure that the site renders correctly for non-screen users. You may experience unexpected behaviour in other browsers, although we use fully validated code which should work on any browser. Issues with links We are aware of the following issues within the links on our site: some link text doesn't make sense when read on its own (for example 'click here') on some pages there are multiple links with the same link text but different destinations on one page many older PDF files contain broken links which do not resolve - we do not intend to resolve these as it is a disproportionate burden for files which are no longer in active use We scan the site weekly for broken links, and look to fix them as soon as they are identified. The content team are working through the links which don't make sense on their own, and we aim to have fixed these by August 2019. Issues with PDFs and other documents PDFs are not able to comply with the requirements of the web accessibility standard, and we do not generally upload new PDFs. Where we do create new PDFs, we use the PDF/A standard which is more accessible. Our site contains a large number of PDFs created in previous years, especially in our data and information publications . Where these are no longer being updated, we do not intend to recreate them in accessible versions as this would be a disproportionate burden . The accessibility regulations don\u2019t require us to fix PDFs or other documents published before 23 September 2018 if they\u2019re not essential to providing our services. By September 2020 we intend to have completed the process of converting PDFs and word documents still in active use into accessible web formats. We do not generally add new PDFs to our site. There are some exceptions: we add some PDFs as downloads of reports or publications, but where a web page version is also available our annual reports , which must, by law, be laid before parliament in a printed version, and then appear unaltered our directions and data provision notices which must, by law, include a signature in order to be valid downloads intended for print purposes, such as posters We also have a number of forms in Microsoft Word format, which are not accessible. We will either replace these with accessible HTML forms, or remove them, by September 2020.

We are aware of the following issues with images and video on our site: Video content uses automated closed captioning and transcripting, and this is often inaccurate. By September 2019 we will review these captions and ensure their accuracy manually. Some of the images on our site are complex diagrams where suitable alt text is not possible. A list of these images is below. By September 2020 we intend to have reviewed all of these images, and where possible will have converted them to accessible format such as SVG, used a different visualisation method, built the visualisation in HTML5, or added detailed description text to the page Known images with accessibility problems Inaccessible images Page containing inaccessible images Type and description HSCN Quality of service overview Technical architecture illustrations GP Connect specifications for developers Specification illustration 7 facts for 7 decades of the NHS Infographic Our staff networks Timeline Commercial and behavioural principles Principles diagram Detailed specification for NHS Digital Reference Data Registers Future enhancements table ITK Use of FHIR based APIs Interoperability status Clinical information standards Several roadmap and vision images Our workforce demographics 2018 Infographics (with alt text) Birth Notification Application Quick Reference Guide Flow chart Care Integration and Orchestration Architectural diagram Clinical safety management Flowchart Data Registers Service: supporting information Lifecycle diagram Harnessing digital technology in maternity services Workstream goals diagram EPS Guidance for developers: Electronic Prescription Service overview Architectural diagrams and operational flowcharts EPS: Guidance for developers: Electronic Prescription Service (EPS) identifiers Identifier design ERS the future of the NHS e-referral service Roadmap Falsified Medicines Directive Implementation Toolkits Process flows and various others Falsified Medicines Directive GP Practice Toolkit Decision tree Falsified Medicines Directive Out-of-hours GP Toolkit Decision tree and scope Falsified Medicines Directive Secondary Care Toolkit Decision tree and options Falsified Mediciness Directive Community Pharmacy Toolkit Decision tree and options Social care DMS - additional messaging guidance Tables HSCN/Transition Network DNS Architectural diagrams HSCN QoS change requests Architectural diagrams HSCN connectivity options Architectural diagrams HSCN troubleshooting Architectural diagrams HSCN Maintaining access to internet services after migrating to HSCN Architectural diagrams HSCN private IT service provider connecting from outside England's borders policy Architectural diagrams HSCN internet access issues guidance Architectural diagrams HSCN N3 overlays replacement guidance Architecural diagrams HSCN Types of remote access solutions Solutions illustration HSCN Transition Network DNS Architectural diagrams HSCN Microsoft DNS servers basic forwarding configuration Architectural diagrams HSCN Test processes - HSCN consumer Screenshot labelling HSCN Connecting to HSCN Decision tree HSCN an introduction for social care Roadmap HSCN customer journey for customer led procurements Roadmap HSCN customer journey for aggregated procurements Roadmap HSCN Private sector organisations: migration advice Roadmap HSCN consumer handbook overview Architectural diagram HSCN Consumer handbook: live HSCN Architectural diagram HSCN consumer handbook: incident handling Architectural diagram Indicator Governance Board - Chair's report 2017/18 Graphs, process flows ITK Release 2.2 Architectural diagrams Mobile technology investment toolkit: important considerations Flow diagrams Mobile technology investment toolkit: Innovative use of mobile technology Flow diagrams Mobile technology investment toolkit: Important considerations Flow diagrams Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) documentation Architectural diagram ERS: The future of the e-referral service Architectural diagram ERS Processing Did Not Attend referrals Flow diagram ERS Clinical Assessment Services (management) Flow diagram ERS Restricted Services Supporting Alternative Care Pathways Flow diagrams/decision trees NHS Identity: Set up NHS Identity's Sandpit Environment Decision trees, flow diagrams NHS Identity: Requirements for NHS Identity Information table NHS Identity: Using NHS Identity - process Decision trees NHS Identity: Self-discovery Decision trees NDOP: compliance implementation guide Flowcharts ODS 2019 changes to regions Maps with text, org chart ODS creating a baseline Architectural diagram ODS ORD API implementation guide Architectural diagram Path to live: Connect to a Path to Live environment Flow diagram SMSP: Stage 1: Getting started quick start Architectural diagram SMSP: Compliance process Flow diagram SMSP Guidance and technical resouces for suppliers and end users Flow diagram SMSP: Connecting to Personal Demographics Service via the spine mini service Flow diagram Data Access Request Service (DARS) performance reporting Graphs Blog: So, what is a Local Health and Care Record anyway?

We will resolve this by August 2019. not all of our content reaches our target reading age of 12 years old. We are resolving this as content comes up through its review cycle, and this should be largely complete by September 2021. some of our page titles are long, causing a technical fail on descriptive titles for web pages which requires titles to be short. In most cases, this is related to legal or formal names for publications. We are not going to fix this, as the content is still understandable, and changing titles might cause compliance issues. Issues with interactive tools We are aware that we have PowerBI and Tableau visualisations available on the website. Neither of these software items are accessible, and cannot be made accessible. In some cases the information is not easily available to users in an accessible format. We are currently investigating accessible visualisation tools. If you require information from these tools, then please contact us .

This tool scans 100% of our web pages, and tests against all the criteria in the guidelines which are possible to automate. The weekly report is reviewed by the website development team, with any actions taken and prioritised into our future work. We aim to fix all high priority issues with one week of them being identified. In addition, we conduct internal testing against known accessiblity issues which are not able to be found through automated testing, on a sampled basis. We last conducted an accessiblity check on these areas in June 2019. Download the data for this chart What automated testing tells us We use automated testing to drive most of our improvements to accessibility on the site. Automated testing can't find everything that could be improved, but is rarely wrong about what it does find. This means we have fixed tens of thousands of accessibility problems which manual checking would have missed. We do also undertake manual testing, including testing with real users with accessibility needs. We follow best practice across the industry, and try to keep up with the latest techniques for making our site accessible. Accessible features we test manually There are a number of accessiblity features which we test manually, which include: colour contrast , which is done at design stage by using tools to check we meet the AAA standard of a contrast ratio of 4.5:1 skip links , which feature across the site suitability for cognitive disablility , including aiming for a reading age of 12 manual check against the W3C validator ensuring that page elements render correctly at all sizes, including when zoomed to 500% assessing content for readability using a mixture of tools which use mathematical methods to assess readability, and manual expert checking checks of colour contrast examining microdata markup and alt text using special tools checking content in a text-only browser using screen readers to read text aloud using disability simulation tools to browse the website What we are doing to improve We are actively looking to improve the accessiblity on our website. The improvements below have been identified on our current work schedule. Accessibility improvement roadmap Target date Item of work Type of work Status August 2019 Finish removing unclear links, like 'See more' Content Ongoing May 2019 Remove deprecated markup from tables, in order to pass validation Developer Backlog June 2019 Change background colour of website to grey in order to better serve dyslexic users Developer Backlog Last edited: 9 July 2019 8:16 am",

      "content": "GPES Data for Pandemic Planning and Research \u2013 Data Protection Impact Assessment PDF - disproportionate burden assessment We've carried out a disproportionate burden assessment on the GPES Data for Pandemic Planning and Research \u2013 Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), which has been published as a 105-page PDF. Page contents Scope As of September 2018, accessibility legislation states that public sector websites must publish content in an accessible format. The GPES Data for Pandemic Planning and Research (COVID-19) Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) has been published on our website as a 105-page PDF. Benefits of creating an accessible version The benefits of creating an HTML version of this PDF would be: a fully accessible version for all users to access an easily searchable and indexable version Burden We\u2019ve estimated that it would take around 2 weeks of a content designer\u2019s time to create an HTML version of this PDF. Other factors Due to the nature of this content, there was a need to publish the document quickly, so we took the decision to publish the PDF as a temporary measure. An HTML page was created specifically to host this PDF , and this page was given the same title as the publication, making it searchable for users. Our intention was to convert this document to an accessible HTML web page. This page was published on 3 December 2020. As of 3 March 2021, analytics show that the page has been viewed 112 times, with only 26 downloads of the PDF document. These figures indicate that interest in this publication is low. Assessment Having considered the estimated effort involved in creating an HTML version, along with the low amount of page views and downloads, we have concluded that the work involved would be a poor use of staff time. This represents a disproportionate burden on the organisation. Last edited: 4 March 2021 11:20 am",

Benefits The benefits of making these PDFs into accessible HTML formats would be: Historical materials would be fully accessible to all users Historical materials would be more easily searchable and indexable Burden Our assessment of the burden of making these PDFs into accessible HTML formats is that: there are thousands of historic documents created by the organisation each document would require a number of hours of work to be recreated in a fully accessible version (estimated based on extensive experience of converting the active documents at between 2 and 30 hours per document, depending on length and complexity, plus any required sign-off) many of the documents are officially published (e.g. Official or National Statistics) and publishing a new version requires detailed checking, a formal sign-off process, and submitting a new official version to the national statistician many of the documents contain complex elements which are difficult to retrospectively convert, such as detailed tables, graphs, and diagrams Other factors Also relevant to this decision are that: Interest in these documents is low \u2013 few people access them The documents do meet accessibility requirements for a large number of users, although some groups will find them disproportionately difficult Of the documents we are proposing would represent a disproportionate burden, requests for additionally accessible versions are rare We have and will always assist with accessible versions on request Assessment Where documents are no longer in active use, or no longer being updated, there is a high cost in terms of employee hours to convert.

      "content": "NHS App disproportionate burden assessment We have carried out a disproportionate burden assessment on the NHS App. This includes using the NHS App for iOS and Android, and accessing the same services by logging in through the NHS website in a web browser. Page contents The Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 require public sector bodies, subject to various exemptions and conditions, to: 1. Make public sector websites and mobile applications accessible. 2. Provide an accessibility statement. The accessibility regulations state that a public sector body does not need to meet the accessibility requirement if this would put a disproportionate burden on them, provided that a disproportionate burden assessment is undertaken. This disproportionate burden assessment relates to two issues in the NHS App for Apple iOS and one issue in the logged in area of the NHS website. 1. Navigating to web content areas using full keyboard access in Apple iOS The full keyboard access feature in Apple iOS does not allow users to navigate into web content areas within the NHS App, as required by WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.1.1 (Keyboard). This is a known platform issue that affects all web content on apps available on Apple iOS. Benefits of creating an accessible version Apple iOS users would be able to use a keyboard to navigate through the entire application. They would not need to rely on screen gestures or other Apple iOS features, such as VoiceOver or Switch Control. Burden Another way that the issue is resolved is if Apple fixes it or to allow keyboard navigation would be to rebuild the NHS App as an entirely web or native app. Assessment As resolving this issue would mean rebuilding the entire NHS App we have decided it is a disproportionate burden. Rebuilding the NHS App would require significant time, funding and resources. Although it may be less convenient, it is possible for NHS App users who cannot use screen gestures to use the VoiceOver or Switch functions in iOS to navigate through web content areas. 2. Resizing text in Apple iOS When using the NHS App on Apple iOS it is not possible to resize the text of some web content using the system settings, as required by WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.4 (resize text). This is a known platform issue that affects all web content on apps available on Apple iOS. Benefits of creating an accessible version Apple iOS users would be able to resize the text of web content on the NHS App. Burden The only way to resolve this issue would be to rebuild the NHS App as an entirely web or native app. Assessment As resolving this issue would mean rebuilding the entire NHS App we have decided it is a disproportionate burden.

      "content": "Breaking down barriers - women in IT NHS Digital showcases some of our expert women in IT as we state our determination to help break down the male-dominated stereotypes in the technology sector. We are proud of the expert women role models we have right across our organisation, from apprentices starting their career journey to our chief executive, Sarah Wilkinson, a regular fixture in most influential women in UK technology lists. For all our progress, the sector remains far too male-dominated. Much more work remains to smash stereotypes and promote the fact that IT jobs are \u2018jobs for the boys and for the girls\u2019. Like others, we still have a long way to go here, and we\u2019re determined to be leaders in this pursuit. Role models are a crucial part of encouraging more women into IT, and we\u2019re proud to showcase just a few of the fantastic women from different areas of our organisation, at different stages of their careers, below. My story - Wendy Clark, director of product development My first role in tech came about by circumstance rather than design, but had I realised then the opportunities, variety, creativity and practical skills I would use every day, then I would have definitely planned my career this way. I started out working on an IT helpdesk, where we not only offered advice and guidance, but also built PCs for our customers. I was the first and only female in my department and I didn\u2019t yet have the specialist technology skills that I would later develop. As a result, lots of the men underestimated me, not realising that I love a challenge! It became important to me to prove that I could not only be as good as them, but better. I committed myself both to the role and to a variety of self-learning and development opportunities. During that time I fell in love with technology and knew this was where I wanted to focus my career. Read more about why NHS Digital is taking action to encourage and support great women to have great careers in technology. Smashing the stereotypes - our cyber apprentice I\u2019ve always enjoyed surprising people. There\u2019s something quite satisfying about it. As a teenager, people never expected me to have flown a plane or to have a weapons handling licence at 13. That wasn\u2019t what they expected a teenage girl to be doing with her time, but we\u2019re all guilty of making assumptions and putting people in boxes. Now aged 19, people are shocked when I tell them that I\u2019m a Cyber Security Apprentice, and I like that. Most of my friends at school went on to study arts subjects, but I realised quickly that if I wanted to impress people, I had to be different and do what I wanted to do. So rather than follow my friends, I chose to take my own path, and it\u2019s the best thing I\u2019ve ever done. Read more about Charlotte's path to being part of a team keeping NHS IT safe from cyber threats... The biomedical science grad working to help saves lives through use of technology Meeting people working on the frontline of healthcare, knowing the work we're doing is making a real difference, is what makes my job at NHS Digital so satisfying. As a junior user researcher I talk to NHS staff and patients to understand what they need technology to do, what problems they may encounter and what they find works for them. User research like this feeds into product and service design, which in turn can have massive benefits for the frontline \u2013 as I also know personally from my own mother\u2019s experience. Read more about how Merissa's own personal experience has made her even more determined to be part of using tech to join up healthcare services to save lives... Why wouldn't you want a role in tech? My tech journey started with my mum who, when I was four years old, became a single mother. She took things into her own hands and did a computer engineering degree and was one of only two women on the course. When I wasn\u2019t at school, I would go with her to university and she would always tell me that IT is for everybody, not just the rich or for men (as it was felt in the 80s). My mum has been a massive role model; she was a real pioneer, later becoming a lecturer in her field. Read more about Melissa's story... Last edited: 26 March 2019 1:37 pm",

I'm a programme head in the Data Services Directorate responsible for the Cumberlege Programme, which is establishing information systems and services to collect new data from perioperative theatre settings to support patient safety and the government\u2019s response to the First Do No Harm report published by Baroness Cumberlege in July 2020. I love working in tech for lots of different reasons but especially because of the challenges and the variety of the work that it offers. I also get the chance to speak and work with lots of different colleagues from different disciplines across the health and care system including chief information officers, clinicians, regulators, and the policy leads for the devolved administrations. We collect lots of different types of data from a range of sources for a spectrum of use cases (from patients, analysts, clinicians to regulators) so there's always new challenges in terms of the way that we bring in the data and the way we link the data together. It\u2019s always hugely rewarding to work with data, technology, and my amazing team to steer a path to success. Who is your female inspiration and why? I have worked for some amazing men and women during my career who have hugely influenced my leadership style. I used to work for Jackie Shears, who was a Women in IT winner, a great inspiration to me and who supported me through some challenging times, making sure that I was recognised for my work. Jacqueline de Rojas CBE is another lady who inspires me as she's very passionate about diversity and women. I think one of the important things about being an inspiring leader is to foster diverse thinking, to encourage constructive challenge, and to support women, and your team, through the different points in their career to ensure individual contributions are recognised and valued. How proud are you to have received a TechWomen100 Award? I am very proud to have been recognised for the work that I did during the pandemic. I was the COVID Test Digital Data Lead during that time, and it was a hugely challenging period requiring long hours, co-ordinating with hundreds of teams and organisations to collect data in a simple yet integrated way to ensure greatest accuracy and utility for the health and care system. The award has also given me an opportunity to extend my network beyond health and care, meeting other award winners and gaining insight into the data and tech challenges that women face in these sectors and sharing approaches for resolution. As a TechWomen100 Award Alumni we are actively encouraged to nominate colleagues for 2022, and beyond, demonstrating the importance of using your leadership position to support career development and champion success.

I have recently started my career in tech, joining NHS Digital on their graduate scheme last September and working in Spine as a software developer. Part of what I love about working in tech is the job itself; I was drawn towards a tech role after studying maths at university and enjoying being able to apply logic and work through problems in a practical sense. The work that NHS Digital does has an impact on everyone and it\u2019s important that the people doing this work are reflective of the UK. Women make up only 11% of software development at NHS Digital and I enjoy being able to have a role within the move toward a more reflective workforce and encouraging others into the sector. Who is your female inspiration and why? Since I have started at NHS Digital I have met and heard from so many women that I find inspiring. Seeing how respected the women in senior level tech positions are, makes me feel that I have a place and a role within the sector. I also find the Women\u2019s Network an inspiring community of people sharing their stories, offering help, and encouraging one another towards their goals. Entering this environment has allowed me to explore different areas that I might enjoy and feel confident in achieving my aspirations. Last edited: 7 March 2022 4:53 pm",

Page contents Why do you love working as a woman in tech and what is your job role? Working in data and technology means being involved in developing the future in a world that heavily depends on technology. It provides the opportunity to create a genuine impact in the way we live. Working as a woman in this area creates a sense of empowerment due to the understanding of being one of few who represent other women working in a heavily male dominated area. Despite the difficulties that are naturally created alongside this, the sense of empowerment provides motivation and enjoyment of being a woman working and developing in, specifically, cyber security. My role working within data and technology is being a Degree Apprentice, currently working as a Trainee Analyst as part of Protective Monitoring within the NHS Digital Cyber Security Operations Centre. Who is your female inspiration and why? My female inspiration is my mum \u2013 a clich\u00e9, yet extremely accurate. My parents had and raised 5 children which meant they had to make sacrifices. But being extremely busy as a mother did not stop my mum from pursuing her professional career, starting with a degree in Philosophy and Greek Civilisation to now being the headteacher of a school. Being able to have a hardworking and driven mother figure has provided me with admiration and a clear image of the type of person that I strive to become. Her experiences of being a woman in the workplace, especially when the divide was even more prominent than it is now, presented me with a role model image derived from feminism and self-drive - an accurate focus of mine in my development as a person and character.

I have been well supported by many men and women throughout my career and I am thankful for help and guidance I have been given. I think it is so important that we have good role models \u2013 \u2018you cannot be what you cannot see\u2019. Dr Sue Black has one of my tech heroes \u2013 she comes from a similar background to me and has managed to build an amazing career as a professor, author and campaigner and I feel very fortunate that I got to meet her in person in 2019. I work in Live Services which is led by the amazing Samantha Robinson. Sam has been such an inspiration to me throughout my time at NHS Digital, she leads from the front with great care for her people, with humour, fun and an absolute determination to deliver for the wider NHS. She is definitely one of my tech heroes. Last edited: 7 March 2022 2:56 pm",

Chloe Knight Communications and Membership Manager at NHS Confederation's Mental Health Network - podcasting Communications professionals are increasingly turning to digital tools to share updates from their organisations, engage staff, patients and the public, and build brand awareness. With a huge range of digital tools out there, it\u2019s often difficult to identify which will be most effective and work well within an NHS setting. The second series of #DigitalDiaries case study will focus on the use of a range of digital tools, from social media platforms to audio and visual software. In the series, we\u2019ll hear from communications professionals who\u2019ve successfully implemented new digital tools, overcoming a range of barriers in the process. The examples shared will also offer tips for successful implementation, aiming to inspire communications professionals across the NHS and academia to try something new. Rachel Royall, Director of Communications at NHS Digital said: \u201cThese case studies really highlight how technology can help us build relationships and connect with people as part of our communications mix. We\u2019re hoping that this series will help to facilitate conversations between communications, information governance and IT professionals, encouraging teams to look at the opportunities of how we can improve the way we communicate in creative and innovative ways.\u201d The first series of case studies include: Great Ormond Street Hospital University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust London Ambulance Service NHS Trust Barts Health NHS Trust My Care Academy UCL Partners @NHS NHS Digital on LinkedIn Last edited: 4 February 2019 1:30 pm",

      "title": "Using Facebook ads to increase referrals to psychological therapies in Essex - NHS Digital",
      "content": "Using Facebook ads to increase referrals to psychological therapies in Essex James Sharp, Digital Media and Marketing Manager at Mid Essex Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), talks about how using Facebook ads have helped to increase referrals to psychological therapies. Page contents In February 2018, our transformation team \u2013 the commissioning engine at the heart of the organisation - recognised that referrals into its Health in Mind service (part of the national initiative Improving Access to Psychological Therapies) \u2013 were under-target. Data indicated that the Health in Mind service was well-regarded but public awareness and accessibility was low. Despite ongoing marketing and promotion by the provider \u2013 CCG commissioners were unhappy that this great service was not being fully-utilised. The transformation team turned to communications and marketing colleagues for help. After several brainstorm sessions and background research across the NHS for best practice, we decided to trial a digital-led solution in a bid to increase referrals. Facebook Advertising - in a nutshell Advertising on Facebook makes it easy to find the right people, capture their attention and get results. You can choose your audience based on demographics, behaviours, contact information or specific keywords. Your adverts are then shown to your target audience in a range of areas on Facebook such as the sidebar. Based on the audience or keyword you select, you pay a certain amount for each time your ad is clicked. The Cost-Per-Click, or CPC, is determined by how many people on Facebook you can reach, and how competitive that audience is. Piloting a new approach Targeted Facebook advertising is a tested approach amongst many accomplished marketeers but is underutilised in the world of NHS digital communications. Working with the CCG\u2019s lead commissioner for mental health, we carefully crafted a series of targeted messages to send to a select audience group during a four week trial period. The aim was to see if using the paid-for advertising arm of Facebook could directly increase the rate of referrals in those selected audience groups. \u201cOverall, referrals to Health in Mind increased by 36% over the trial period with a marked improvement in male referrals.\u201d Driving uptake of services Over the course of the four-week trial, this digital marketing approach managed to increase traffic by almost 74% to the CCG website page on Health in Mind. A total of 341 visits to the page came directly from Facebook compared to just 24 visits the month before the campaign. Overall, referrals to Health in Mind increased by 36% over the trial period with a marked improvement in male referrals - one of the specific targeted audiences identified) \u2013 especially after some specific messaging during men\u2019s mental health awareness week and the national launch of the CALM initiative (Campaign Against Living Miserably) \u2013 an awareness campaign aimed at supporting men with mental health. The provider feedback demonstrated a week-on-week increase in referrals. Asking the audience One of the unique aspects of our digital approach was use of imagery. We set up a small virtual focus group of men aged between 25 and 45 to gain feedback on types of images to use and content of messaging. The feedback from the group was to steer away from the traditional photos used of people looking anxious or worried and focused instead on depicting a positive, everyday image to attract a wider cohort of the targeted audience. All advertising went out with the premise of by self-referring to Health in Mind, you can \u201cfind ways to get help you get back to the things you enjoy.\u201d Since the Health in Mind Facebook trial, the CCG\u2019s transformation team has championed digital advertising for two other services; given lessons-learned and practical mentoring to communications and commissioning colleagues in other Essex CCGs. I have shared lessons learned with the commissioned providers own marketing team and given 1-2-1 tuition in advertising approaches on Facebook and with other social media. We have used this approach for a different project to similar effect and results and we have now revised our Digital Strategy to incorporate this methodology into future project plans and communications approaches. Examples of this are \u2013 in July 2018, the CCG will be launching a web and app-based mental health platform \u2013 Silvercloud. The primary approach to marketing this in mid Essex will be via Facebook advertising. The social media advertising story Caroline Rassell, Accountable Officer NHS Mid Essex CCG says that Facebook advertising provides good results and explains that using it fits with the organisations innovative approach \u201cI was initially sceptical that social media advertising would work for the CCG, but as an organisation that recognises the need for continued improvement and innovation, coupled with a compelling case from our Digital Communications team we knew we had to give it a try. Social advertising allowed us to place adverts in front of people we wanted to target with good, demonstrable results. It has transformed the way we approach our communications and has given us a new way to engage local people.\u201d The digital tool featured in this case study is an example of a resource being used by UCLPartners and/or its partner organisations. Its usage does not indicate endorsement by NHS Digital.

Without it, there's a real risk of negative impacts affecting the energy and material footprint of the healthcare system. Page contents Community of interest The Sustainable Healthcare Technology programme is now partnering with suppliers and healthcare providers. The aim is to set up a community of interest, working towards a shared goal to improve sustainability. This work will enable the health and care system to achieve: reduced ICT emissions realise cost savings improve health outcomes To collaborate with us and help shape the way healthcare technology is designed, please join our community of interest. Get in touch today and find out more. Email: sustainability.team@nhs.net The 4 challenges Check out these examples of best practice. See how other organisations are addressing sustainability challenges in the tech environment. Tech foot-printing Do you know the environmental impact of your technology assets? ICT footprint shares success stories from other global organisations. Procurement Are you making sure you are buying sustainable technology? Learn about BT's approach to digital impact and sustainability and how it's helping its customers cut their carbon emissions. Enabled savings Does your technology lead to wider sustainability improvements in relation to travel, estate reductions or going paperless for example? The Green ICT workbook supports the 'Greening Government ICT Strategy'. It helps government departments to transform the ICT landscape to create a more productive, flexible workforce that delivers digital public services in a much more cost-effective way. Data Global data use is growing exponentially. Are you considering data resolution, retention and value creation? Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust\u2019s case study shows an example of how a trust can build a super-efficient facility. How to lower your impact There are things you and your organisation can do right now to help reduce carbon emissions. Choose the lowest energy device Encourage people to use lower energy consuming devices to view webpages. Smaller devices tend to use less energy than larger devices, for example: smartphone - 1 watt* tablet - 5.5 watts* laptop - 15 watts* desktop computer - 77 watts* *Energy used is per webpage viewed Switch off your devices when not in use 'Vampire energy', or standby power, is the energy consumed when a device is on standby, still plugged in and not fully shut down. You can minimise the energy loss by turning off your electronic equipment at source rather than leaving devices on standby. You can also save energy by adjusting the brightness of your screens according to the ambient lighting. Reducing screen brightness saves as much as 20% of energy used by an average computer screen. Spring clean your data storage Data use is growing exponentially, doubling every 2 years ( Inside Big Data, 2017 ), needing more infrastructure to store it. There is a need to review whether we need all the data we have accumulated, and how long we need to keep it for. Cleaning up, archiving, compressing or deleting files can reduce the amount of storage space needed. Consider an annual \u2018spring clean\u2019 of your files and data, by removing unused or unnecessarily large files on your devices. Go fully digital to increase your digital collaboration Using digital tools such as 'Skype for Business' to host meetings can reduce the need for travelling to meetings. On average, a 4 hour return train journey emits as much as 11.64kg of carbon dioxide (CO2) per person. Whilst this may seem small, the numbers can add up quickly. Where there is potential for hosting meetings online, this should be considered as a priority to improve accessibility for those who cannot meet in person, reduce CO2 emissions, and reduce costs. Go paperless Going paperless not only reduces your environmental footprint but can improve your efficiency at work. There are many applications and services which can enhance your productivity, organisation and increase your digital collaboration with your colleagues, without the need for print. Use low resolution image and video files Use the lowest resolution you can for large image and video files. Living in a world of exponential data growth, its management and reduction becomes a key issue as data use and storage equates directly to energy and material use. Image resolution has a huge impact on data requirements. In fact, for non-business internet, 80% of data transfer is online TV streaming. Watching a high definition (HD) movie at home often has a higher carbon footprint than a trip to the cinema. This means a choice of standard resolution video streaming for the coming step change in smart phone GP appointments could have a huge sustainability impact. Buy green energy and hardware There is major variation in the sustainability credentials of electronics devices. A huge 80% of energy use in electronics such as smartphones and laptops is energy used to build devices during the manufacturing process. Procurement teams, therefore, need to look at the entire process of creating these products, from material sourcing to manufacturing, from production to disposal. There are organisations that can help us understand the scale of these impacts, whilst highlighting the good practices of technology companies. The Greenpeace Guide to Greener Electronics is a useful resource to start understanding this issue in more detail and accreditations such as TCO Certified also apply. Cloud storage first Cloud storage facilities typically try to use server space and power in the most efficient ways possible ( Government Digital Service, 2018 ). Cloud storage providers have been evaluated based on energy mixes used to power their data servers. Use Greenpeace's Click Clean tool to find out which cloud-based server offers efficiency in cloud providers.

It is used as a cross-government agreed standard as part of the spend control process. Green government ICT case studies These case studies relate to the \u2018Greening Government ICT Strategy\u2019, which was published in 2011. They show the environment and approaches needed to transform the ICT landscape to create a more productive, flexible workforce that delivers digital public services in a much more cost-effective way.

Greening Digital survey NHS Digital is inviting input and expertise from health IT professionals to better understand how we may take this work forward. Take part in the survey How long it will take The survey should only take you around 10 minutes to complete. Who should complete it It should be completed on behalf of your organisation by your relevant Chief Information Officer, Chief Clinical Information Officer, ICT lead or the manager with delegated authority for leading on sustainability at your Trust - if this is not you, please pass it on to the relevant person. Findings Findings will help inform a wider NHS Digital and NHS England \u2018Greening Digital\u2019 project which will consider how sustainability can be built into digital and technology projects at a local and national level.

NHS Digital complaints process We have a four-stage process for dealing with complaints. We'll try to resolve your complaint at the earliest stage possible. If you're unhappy with our service, you should let us know as soon as you can. Most problems can be sorted out quickly without needing to go through the official complaints process. Call our enquiries line to speak to a member of staff - call 0300 303 5678 and select option 2. Stage 1 - Make a complaint To make a complaint, you can: email enquiries@nhsdigital.nhs.uk , putting 'stage 1 complaint' in the subject line call our general enquiries line 0300 303 5678 (selecting option 2) You should put detailed complaints in writing to make sure we cover all your concerns. We will need: a clear, detailed description of your complaint copies of any letters or emails about the matter any correspondence reference number your email address or postal address so we can reply How we handle stage 1 complaints We will look at your complaint and work with the department concerned to resolve it. Timescale We try to resolve complaints in 10 working days. If your complaint is complex this might not be possible. If we need more time we'll let you know and tell you when you can expect a response. Outcome We'll send you a response to your complaint telling you what we will do to resolve it. Most complaints are resolved at this stage. Stage 2 - Make a formal complaint If you don't feel we've resolved your complaint after stage 1, you can make a formal complaint by post, phone, or online. You should put detailed complaints in writing to make sure we cover all your concerns. You can: write to the complaints manager: NHS Digital 1 Trevelyan Square Boar Lane Leeds LS1 6AE Email enquiries@nhsdigital.nhs.uk , putting 'stage 2 complaint' in the subject line. How we handle stage 2 complaints When we get your stage 2 complaint we will: tell you we've got it and give you a reference number within 2 working days investigate your complaint - the executive director of the area you're complaining about will do this Timescale We try to resolve formal complaints within 20 working days. If your complaint is complex this might not be possible. If we need more time we'll let you know and tell you when you can expect a response. Outcome You'll get a formal response from the director who investigates your case. Stage 3: Request an independent internal review If you're not satisfied with the response to your stage 2 complaint you can ask for an independent internal review. To do this, write to the complaints manager and tell them why you feel your problem has not been resolved. You must do this within 28 days of getting the formal response to your stage 2 complaint. How we handle stage 3 complaints A non-executive director of NHS Digital will look at your case. They will ask for advice where appropriate and choose whether to: ask the complaints manager to re-investigate your complaint set up an independent review panel tell you that they have looked at the facts and will not be taking any further action If the director decides an independent review would help resolve your complaint, an independent chairperson will be invited to sit on the panel and they will ask for the views of everyone involved. Timescale We'll work as quickly as we can to do this, but the length of time taken will vary. Outcome If the complaints manager re-investigates, you will get a formal response. If there's an independent review, we'll send a short report on the panel's findings to you, and to the Chief Executive of NHS Digital. The panel can't discipline anyone or award compensation but it can make recommendations. Stage 4 - Complain to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman If you don't feel that your complaint has been resolved after stage 3, you can contact the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman. The PHSO makes final decisions on unresolved complaints about NHS organisations in England. It's an independent service which is free for everyone to use. To complain to the Ombudsman, visit the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman website or call 0345 015 4033. Last edited: 29 April 2019 10:42 am",

Thank you for your email dated 11 December 2020 requesting the following information: \u201d 1. The number of people admitted to A&E between March 2020 - December 2020 compared to the same time period in 2019 and 2018? 2. The number of patients receiving chemotherapy between March 2020 - December 2020 compared to the same time period in 2019 and 2018? 3. The number of deaths from all causes between March 2020 - December 2020 compared to the same time period in 2019 and 2018? to 4. The number of deaths from suicide between March 2020 - December 2020 compared to the same time period in 2019 and 2018? 5. A breakdown of the number of deaths by every cause between March 2020 - December 2020 compared to the same time period in 2019 and 2018?\u201d We have considered your request and in accordance with S.1 (1) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA) I can confirm that we do hold part of the information that you have requested. In regards to question 1, our Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) database is not the official source of total A&E activity, this is the NHS England situation reports collection - However, HES permits further analysis of A&E activity as there are a range of data items by which HES can be analysed. Finalised A&E data from HES can be found by using the link below; Hospital Accident & Emergency Activity 2019-20 - NHS Digital This link will only provide data for April 2019 \u2013 March 2020, for provisional data from April to October 2020 please use the link below; Accident and Emergency Quality Indicators - NHS Digital Please note data for November and December 2020 has not been published yet. November data will be published on 14 January 2021 and December data will be published on 11 February 2021. The data NHS Digital holds regarding admissions to A&E and chemotherapy treatment is known to be provisional for the months of November and December. This is due to data quality issues arising from a variation in working methods and recording between different providers. Work is ongoing to understand these data quality issues, and the way in which they affect interpretation of the data. Releasing this data prior to completion of this work will inhibit the exchange of views for the purposes of deliberation and prejudice the effective conduct of public affairs. Therefore, we are applying Section 22 to this element of the request. In regards to question 2, we do not hold the information in the format that you have requested it. To obtain this, you would need to submit a bespoke tabulation via our Data Access Request Service (DARS). Through DARS there are two processes to request data dependant on the level of data required. Information in tabulated form including suppressed data (i.e. small numbers are aggregated to stop people identifying themselves and others), can be requested through the DARS service without a legal basis.

      "content": "Freedom of Information request NIC-690159-K8H4Z Freedom of information request to provide more information about the format of NHS numbers and to request a guide/reference or index to these number structures. I understand that the format of NHS numbers has varied over time, and that each format was probably in force for a specific period. Do you hold a guide / reference / index to these differing number structures and the periods that they applied to?\u201d We have considered your request and in accordance with S.1 (1) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA) I can confirm that we do hold the information that you have requested. NHS Digital has no specific guidance about NHS Number formats prior to the introduction of the current 10 digit NHS Number in 1995/1996, in order to facilitate the implementation of the electronic health record. Over 20 different formats of NHS Number were in use prior to 1995 which made accurate validation of records very difficult and necessitated the introduction of a new single unique identifier. \"New NHS numbers\" were allocated to every new-born from July 1995, generally introduced in 1996, and became mandatory on 1 April 1999. This replaced the previous system founded on wartime identity card numbers, which in England and Wales used letters and digits (e.g. JRDAN 269); The numerical part of ID/NHS numbers allocated to people born after the Second World War in England and Wales matched the birth register entry number (i.e. a person whose birth was entry number xy would have an ID/NHS number in the format LLLLxy). The letters contained within the ID/NHS Number, related to the area of England or the office allocating the number. Between 1969 and July 1995, the old-style NHS number was used on a baby's birth certificate as the reference number for the certificate. The NHS number was developed to support unique patient identification within the NHS. It is a unique 10-digit number. The first nine digits are the identifier and the tenth is a check digit used to confirm the number's validity. There is no significance to any of the digits.. This style of numbering was introduced in 1996 replacing a variety of previous systems. The NHS number should be displayed and printed in a '3 3 4' format (e.g. 943 476 5919). The National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) published a Safer Practice Notice (SPN) for the NHS number in September 2008 which advised all NHS organisations to use the NHS number as the national patient identifier. The NHS number is now widely used within health and social care organisations and should be present on all patient and service user records, both paper and electronic, as early in the care pathway as possible. It must be used alongside other demographic information to link together the correct records for a particular patient or service user. The current 10-digit NHS Number, is made up of 9 digits with the tenth digit being a checksum. The checksum is calculated by multiplying each of the first nine digits by 11 minus its position. Using the number 943 476 5919 as an example the first digit is 9. This is multiplied by 10 the second digit is 4. This is multiplied by 9 and so on until the ninth digit (1) is multiplied by 2 the result of this calculation is summed. In this example: 9*10+4*9+3*8+4*7+7*6+6*5+5*4+9*3+1*2 = 299 the remainder when dividing this number by 11 is calculated, yielding a number in the range 0\u201310, which would be 2 in this case finally, this number is subtracted from 11 to give the checksum in the range 1\u201311, in this case 9, which becomes the last digit of the NHS number a checksum of 11 is represented by 0 in the final NHS number. If the checksum is 10 then the number is not valid All people registered for primary care will have a valid NHS Number and record on PDS. Very few people resident within England and Wales will not have an NHS Number and PDS record. NHS Numbers are never re-used and are issued / allocated from the following ranges. 000-000-001 to 009-999-999 Unreserved (not in use) 010-000-000 to 311-299-999 Not to be issued (Scotland CHI numbers) 311-300-000 to 319-999-999 Unreserved 320-000-000 to 399-999-999 Northern Ireland 400-000-000 to 499-999-999 England Wales and IOM 500-000-000 to 599-999-999 Not to be issued 600-000-000 to 799-999-999 England Wales and IOM 800-000-000 to 859-999-999 Reserved for possible future use by Republic of Ireland 860-000-000 to 899-999-999 Unreserved 900-000-000 to 999-999-999 Not to be issued (Synthetic/test patients PDS) Currently all NHS Numbers in use are from the 4, 6 and 7 ranges with a few from the 3 range where patients from Northern Ireland have registered for primary care in England and the NHS Numbers have been added to P ersonal Demographics Service (PDS) .

The data NHS Digital\u2019s Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) Team holds, only covers miscarriages involving a hospital stay and it is also limited to NHS hospitals in England. However, if this information is of interest, the NHS Maternity Statistics report includes some tables showing miscarriage data . The tables in question can be found on the time series, age of mother and deprivation tabs. Also, NHS Digital\u2019s Maternity Statistics Dataset (MSDS) Team are able to produce some data but these would be heavily caveated as follows: Miscarriages will only be included that have taken place after the mother has booked with a maternity service, so very early miscarriages would not be picked up. Miscarriages that are not reported back to the maternity service for whatever reason would not be recorded, so\u2026 MSDS only get a fraction of the true number of miscarriages. a) Miscarriages that happen before booking will not be included. b) Miscarriages that happen after booking and aren\u2019t reported to the booking organisation will not be included. c) Those that are left null or recorded as 06 (no further contact) will not be included. Therefore the only inclusions will be miscarriages that happen after booking and are reported to the booking organisation. Also, the recent changes to the dataset mean that the way data is recorded has changed. See data quality statements in the monthly publications . If you are interested in latter data set, please recontact and this can be provided. Last edited: 7 October 2020 2:52 pm",

      "content": "Freedom of information request NIC-388110-Q0Z9D Thank you for your email dated 23 June 2020 in relation to the following information: \u201cAt the start of the Covid19 epidemic when HM Government introduced lockdown and the closing of businesses and of the furloughing of workers, the Minister of Health for England announced publicly on 25 March 2020 on television and via the statement release as identified in the following link; www.england.nhs.uk entitled;- Issue 3;Preparedness letter for primary dental care-25 March 2020. bearing publication reference ; 001559. The statement issued by the Minister of Health states that Dental Practices would still receive the full amount of monthly Dental Contract Payments as paid pre covid19 epidemic, provided that the members of the dental team signed up to be redeployed within any other aspect of the NHS services that required their service and also provided that the contract holder of the said monthly payment continued to pay the Associates at their pre covid19 rate of pay as if nothing had happened. I therefore request information under the Freedom of Information Act to the following questions, assuming that the above requirements had been met; 1) If the contract holder receiving the full monthly Dental Contract Payment then wilfully and unilaterally without consultation, withholds the full pre covid19 rate of payment to the Associate Dentists as he had been instructed to pay to the Associate Dentists by the Minister of Health and pay them at a lower rate, would the dental contract holder then be in breach of contract with NHS England for not complying with the Ministerial instructions? 2) If the said contract holder acted as in request number 1 as above, would the contract holder then be reprimanded by NHS England or the Ministry of Health for not complying with their instructions? 3) If the said contract holder acted as in request number 1 as above, would the contract holder then be financially penalised by NHS England or the Ministry of Health for not complying with their instructions? 4) If the said contract holder acted as in request number 1 as above, would the contract holder then be at risk of having his Dental Contract terminated either temporarily or permanently by NHS England or the Ministry of Health for not complying with their instructions?\u201d We have considered your request and in accordance with S.1 (1) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA) I can confirm that we do not hold the information you have requested.

Our response Thank you for your email dated 02 March 2021 requesting the following information: \u201cI would like to make an FOI request for the following for IAPT data: What is the national rate (% and mean n) of single sessions reported by IAPT services? (i.e. those who attend 1 session and then are discharged) What is the treatment conversion rate for IAPT services including single sessions? (IAPT definition of treatment (more than 2 sessions) divided by referral rate \u2013 if you work this out differently, what is the calculation for conversion rates?). (% and mean n) What is the treatment conversion rate for IAPT services excluding single sessions? (% and mean n) What is the treatment completion rate for IAPT services? (percentage of discharges from those accepted into treatment) (% and mean n) What is the national rate for treatment discharges for those who have been accepted for treatment and what is the discharge rate when looking it at all referrals (clock starts) to discharge? (% and mean n) What is the proportion of single sessions that make up the prevalence / access figure (i.e. % of access KPI made up from single sessions) Can these be broken down into National rates and rates for Greater Manchester CCGs?\u201d We have considered your request and in accordance with S.1 (1) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA) I can confirm that we do hold part of the information that you have requested. The IAPT dataset changed from v1.5 (up to September 2020) to v2.0 (from Sept 2020 onwards). There will be some differences in the way activity is recorded between the different versions. Improving access to psychological therapies data set reports What is the national rate (% and mean n) of single sessions reported by IAPT services? (i.e. those who attend 1 session and then are discharged) The number of people attending a single session is published in the monthly reports as \u2018Count_EndedTreatedOnce\u2019 in v2.0 or \u2018EndedTreatedOnce\u2019 in v1.5. This data is available Monthly, for the following geographic breakdowns: England, Provider, CCG and CCG/Provider levels Both v1.5 and v2.0 have extensive breakdowns of how treatment was ended. This data is published in the monthly activity file. The table below provides examples of these breakdowns. Each measure in v1.5 has a column with the appropriate heading and in v2.0 the breakdowns are listed in the \u2018 measure_name \u2019 column. v1.5 MEASURE_NAME v2.0 MEASURE_NAME EndedBeforeAssessment Count_EndedBeforeAssessment EndedDeclined Count_EndedDeclined EndedDeceasedAssessedOnly Count_EndedDeceasedAssessedOnly EndedCompleted Count_EndedCompleted EndedDeceasedTreated Count_EndedDeceasedTreated AptAttended Count_ApptsAttended AptAttendedLate Count_ApptsAttendedLate EndedBeforeTreatment Count_EndedBeforeTreatment Count_EndedIncompleteAssessment Count_EndedBeforePatientRequested Count_EndedBeforeCareProfessionalPlanned Annual data is not available for these measures. What is the treatment conversion rate for IAPT services including single sessions? (IAPT definition of treatment (more than 2 sessions) divided by referral rate \u2013 if you work this out differently, what is the calculation for conversion rates?). (% and mean n) A referral is classed as completing a course of treatment when they have had 2 treatment sessions. As such we do not calculate figures based on single treatment appointments but the component parts such as ended treated once and number of referrals is available in the monthly publications. If this is not the information you require, please could you clarify what is meant by \u2018 conversion rate\u2019 ? (E.g. number of referrals that are completing treatment or number of referrals etc). What is the treatment conversion rate for IAPT services excluding single sessions? (% and mean n) Data for \u2018 finished course treatment \u2019 and \u2018 count of referrals \u2019 are available in the published data. It is however worth bearing in mind that these two measures are not based on the same group of referrals. Number of referrals is the number of referrals in the reporting period (i.e. month) whereas finished a course of treatment is the number of referrals where the referral ended in the reporting period (i.e. month), therefore these referrals will not necessarily have started in that reporting period. If this is not the information you require, please could you provide clarification on the term \u2018 conversion rate \u2019 as stated above for us to investigate further. What is the treatment completion rate for IAPT services? (percentage of discharges from those accepted into treatment) (% and mean n) We currently publish this figure each month in the \u2018Activity\u2019 section of the IAPT monthly publication page. It is calculated as follows: Number of referrals completing a course of treatment / Number of ended referrals. What is the national rate for treatment discharges for those who have been accepted for treatment and what is the discharge rate when looking it at all referrals (clock starts) to discharge? (% and mean n) Please see monthly and annual reports for available figures. If the information contained within these reports is not what you are requiring, please could you provide further clarification so that we can investigate further. What is the proportion of single sessions that make up the prevalence/access figure (i.e. % of access KPI made up from single sessions) NHS Digital do not publish access rates. Access rates are determined by dividing the number of referrals to IAPT services in a given period (the numerator for the calculation) by the number of people suffering from IAPT - relevant disorders in the wider population (also known as prevalence \u2013 this is the denominator for the calculation). The numerator for this rate is the number of referrals entering treatment, which is published in the Monthly and Quarterly Activity Data File CSVs as column \u2018Count_FirstTreatment \u2019. The denominator is an estimate based on the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey, Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing, England, 2014 . This information is not held at the relevant geographies by NHS Digital and so is not included in our publications. The relevant data can be requested from NHS England.

Page contents Thank you for your email dated 12 October 2020 requesting the following information: I would like to request data on figures for all NHS Hospital and Community Health Services Doctors and GPs: Total number of doctors; Number of joiners to the NHS; and Number of leavers from the NHS. Please may I have the data broken down by: Grade (Consultant, Specialty doctor, etc.); and Nationality (UK, EU, Overseas); and Place of Primary Medical Qualification (UK, EU, or Overseas). For leavers only \u2013 an additional breakdown on the reason for leaving. I would like to request the data for each year ending on 30 June. For example, 30 June 2016 should include the total number of joiners/leavers since 1 July 2015. I would like to have this data split into 6 tables: Total number of HCHS doctors; Total number of GPs; Number of HCHS joiners to the NHS; Number of GP joiners to the NHS; Number of HCHS leavers from the NHS; Number of GP leavers from the NHS. We have considered your request and in accordance with S.1 (1) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA) and can confirm that we do hold some of the information that you have requested. Data is collected and published separately for NHS Hospital and Community Health Services Doctors and GPs, and the below relates only to GPs: General Practice Workforce figures are available from September 2015 to June 2020 in our most recent publication . The Bulletin Tables Excel file includes England-level time series for all reporting periods where data was collected. This was initially biannually from September 2015, becoming quarterly from December 2016 onwards. No data was collected for June 2016. Table 4 in the Bulletin file contains figures for General Practitioners by Country of Qualification Group, where known. Figures are not available broken down by Grade or Nationality, neither of which are collected for GPs. Figures on staff movement within General Practice, and Joiners and Leavers from it, are only calculated and reported biannually for March and September data. The most recent available figures are in the September 2019 publication in the Supplementary Tables file showing figures in the time series from September 2015 to September 2019. Staff movement and joiner/leaver data for March 2020 was not published due to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on practices\u2019 ability to update their records which led to a suspected under-reporting of data changes for the March 2020 extract, which reduced the quality of the data available for the publication. Tables 4a to 6b include figures on staff movement, including by Reason for Leaving, which relate to all staff joining and leaving practices within the reporting periods and not only to those joining and leaving general practice outright. For example one person moving from practice A to practice B to practice C within one time period would be counted as a leaver twice and a joiner twice, and would not have left Primary Care/General Practice at any point. Information on recruitment sources, reasons for leaving and destinations on leaving is reported where it is provided, but for some records this information is unknown and therefore all tables include an \u2018Unknown\u2019 row. Figures for joiners and leavers to and from General Practice overall are only available for Qualified Permanent GPs (excludes Registrars & Locums) in an experimental format, and can be found in tables 13a to 14b. These figures are for those identified as joining and leaving the workforce category of Qualified Permanent GPs (excludes Registrars & Locums) in General Practice, and may include those moving too and from the GP registrar (trainee) and GP locum job roles in General Practice, and also those moving to or from other settings within the wider healthcare system including secondary care and alternative primary care settings such as extended access. We have produced three files which are attached and address the NHS hospital and community health services doctors aspect of the request. The three files provided are: HCHS Doctors by grade, nationality & cqual, Jun15-Jun20_AH3524 - Staff in Post This shows the total number of Hospital and Community Health Services (HCHS) doctors by grade, nationality and country of qualification, for June 2015 to June 2020. HCHS Doctors by grade, nationality & cqual, Jun15-Jun20_AH3524 \u2013 Turnover This shows the total number of HCHS doctors joiners and leavers to the NHS, by grade, nationality and country of qualification, for June 2015 to June 2020. HCHS Doctors leavers, Jun15-Jun20_AH3524 - Reason for leaving The final piece of the analysis links the leavers displayed in the HCHS Doctors by grade, nationality and cqual, Jun15-Jun20_AH3524 \u2013 Turnover file to their reason for leaving where this is recorded. We have done this for total HCHS doctors only. Reason for leaving data is not available by grade/nationality/country of qualification as it would be too disclosive.

On Signs of gender dysphoria https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gender-dysphoria/symptoms/ , the reference for this line: \u201cMost children who seem confused about their gender identity when young will not continue to feel the same way beyond puberty\u201d is: \u201cIn follow-up studies of prepubertal children (mainly boys) who were referred to clinics for assessment of gender dysphoria, the dysphoria persisted into adulthood for only 6\u201323% of children (Cohen-Kettenis, 2001; Zucker & Bradley, 1995). Boys in these studies were more likely to identify as gay in adulthood than as transgender (Green, 1987; Money & Russo, 1979; Zucker & Bradley, 1995; Zucker, 1984). Newer studies, also including girls, showed a 12\u201327% persistence rate of gender dysphoria into adulthood (Drummond, Bradley, Peterson- Badali, & Zucker, 2008; Wallien & Cohen-Kettenis, 2008).\u201d This is included in NHS England's Service Specification for the Gender Identity development service . \u2018Young\u2019 refers to pre-pubertal (see studies cited for age ranges). The content of the NHS.UK page was produced by the NHS.UK content team based on user needs and evidence, including the current service specifications and the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) guidelines. It was clinically signed off by the Gender Dysphoria Clinical Reference Group (CRG) and other clinical experts who provide clinical advice to national policy in this area. We do not hold information on the qualifications and relevant medical experience of the experts involved. Last edited: 7 September 2021 10:04 am",

We're focused on building a workforce that better represents our customers, health and care staff and the communities we serve, while ensuring that all our colleagues can bring their whole self to work and feel like they truly belong here at NHS Digital. As you will see, we've made good progress on delivering many of the actions around inclusion set out in our People Plan. However, we are not yet seeing big changes in the diversity of our workforce and have identified areas where we still need to do more. We also know that currently, the quality of our employee experience differs depending on certain characteristics, which is totally unacceptable. We will continue to listen, learn and understand perspectives from all of our colleagues, with the help of our 7 staff networks, and make changes to ensure everyone feels supported and able to thrive. More broadly, we're delivering a wide range of events, training and development to strengthen all of our understanding about what it takes to create an inclusive environment and to behave in a truly inclusive way. Our ambition is to make NHS Digital the best place to work by creating an environment where colleagues feel that they can perform to their full potential, no matter their background, identity, or circumstances. We want everyone in our organisation to feel valued, that they belong and that their contribution matters. Thank you for joining us on our inclusion journey. Best, Sarah Wilkinson, Chief Executive.

We are publishing this report, as previously agreed, in February 2022. We know that moving forward our aims and actions will need to align and complement those of our new NHS family, and we very much look forward to that collaboration. However, we have taken the decision to share the report as originally intended in order to record and track progress on our promises to date, and to demonstrate the importance of our commitments as guiding principles during our transition to NHS England. We will not lose sight of these aims as we navigate this change. However, it's reassuring to already know that improving diversity and inclusion outcomes and experiences is of equal importance to the colleagues and senior leaders that we join.

How our diversity is changing We're not seeing big changes in how our organisation is made up. Benchmarking shows NHS Digital is broadly aligned to the working population nationally, but there are some differences at regional level and in senior grades. Aside from the need for caution around levels of declaration in our data, and the delay often associated with a project\u2019s intended impact, it appears that our interventions, while extremely meaningful and impactful in terms of advancing awareness and fostering an inclusive culture, haven not yet translated into significant shifts in the diversity of our workforce. 2021 workforce diversity snapshot Download the data for this chart Gender (sex) Download the data for this chart Ethnic origin Download the data for this chart Disability Download the data for this chart Sexual orientation Download the data for this chart Age band Download the data for this chart Marital status Download the data for this chart Religious belief An overview of our statistics 45% female and 55% male 41% of new joiners were women 34% of internal promotions were women 4% declare they are LGB+ 13% declare they are black, Asian and minority ethnic 10% of starters in the Electronic Staff Record (ESR) were black, Asian and minority ethnic 5% declare they are disabled workforce maternity/adoption leave rate was 1% 79 employees were on maternity or adoption leave 29 took paternity/additional paternity or adoption leave 8 took shared parental/adoption leave 25% of new starters were aged 25 or under Executive Senior Manager diversity snapshot Download the data for this chart Gender (sex) Download the data for this chart Ethnic origin Download the data for this chart Disability Download the data for this chart Sexual orientation Download the data for this chart Age band Download the data for this chart Marital status Download the data for this chart Religious belief 2025 diversity targets The Board have endorsed targets of 19% black, Asian and minority ethnic, 14% disabled and 50% female colleagues at all levels by 2025. This reflects NHS England and Improvement's commitment on ethnicity, the economically active rate of disabled people in the population and parity for gender. The targets are a step forward, however it will take all of us in the organisation to shift the historic dial on our workforce diversity. We require deliberate and concerted focus and effort in tandem with action over time across a range of available levers. We will be taking proactive steps to remove barriers to participation, reduce bias and provide support to ensure a level playing field for all. Characteristics broken down by pay band The following data was taken from ESR at the end of the 2020/21 financial year and is a snapshot of the employee population at a particular point in time. When our protected characteristics are further broken down by grade, the picture changes, and the following trends are evident: Female representation has increased in percentage points since 2017 in bands 7, 8a to 8d and Personal Salary. Download the data for this chart Female representation by pay band Black, Asian and minority ethnic representation has increased in percentage points since 2017 in bands 2 to 4, band 5, band 8b to 8d and Personal Salary. The drop in Personal Salary is due to a significant decrease in the positions identified in this category, from 27 to 6. Download the data for this chart Black, Asian and minority ethnic representation by pay band The disabled representation rate has mostly remained consistent. The disabled representation has increased in percentage points since 2017 in bands 2 to 4, band 6 and Personal Salary. Download the data for this chart Disability representation by pay band We recognise that, like many other organisations and the NHS more broadly, there is a general lack of diversity within the senior grades. We know that barriers to career progression and lack of representative role models are among the influential factors here. This is why we're making a strong organisational commitment to our diversity targets, and their associated actions is so critical.

Our ambition is still to make NHS Digital the best and most inclusive place to work, to ensure we provide equality of opportunity and an inclusive employee experience for everyone. We will continue to listen, understand, and support our colleagues. Our staff networks have continued to play an instrumental role in our progress, and we will maintain and build on our collaboration with them to deliver our inclusion actions. We've also recognised the need to broaden accountability to each and every person within NHS Digital. In an uncertain and changing environment, creating an inclusive culture, managing a diverse workforce, and improving our ways of working remain our top priorities. We need to increase declaration rates, test the impact of the recruitment and selection changes we are making for career progression, and monitor the effectiveness of our first Positive Action Development scheme for underrepresented groups. All the while continuing to encourage colleagues to talk openly about their experiences of working here. Seeking diversity, creating inclusion, and improving lives will take time and requires clear direction, consistent action over several years, and smart decisions made from robust data. We will continue our relentless pursuit to make NHS Digital the best and most inclusive place to work, to deliver on our commitments and conduct regular benchmarking and evaluation to measure progress and ensure alignment with NHS and the health and care sector. How will we know when we have arrived? when our people tell us they feel they can be themselves at work and they feel valued for the difference that they bring when our teams and senior leaders are representative of the people we serve when all of our actions truly demonstrate a zero-tolerance to inappropriate behaviour, and it is safe to challenge at all levels Achieving the objectives will be underpinned and shaped by a blended insights approach comprising quantitative and qualitative data and close partnering with our staff networks to bring lived experiences to the fore. We will continue to monitor our progress by identifying barriers to inclusion through internal and external benchmarking.

Our Board and Executive Management Team are personally committed, and we will continue engaging with colleagues to get their support to build a culture at NHS Digital, where we are all actively working to eliminate discrimination and support inclusion. A People Plan to provide direction Our People Plan remains the foundation for our overall ambition of making NHS Digital the best and most inclusive place to work. Our priorities being diverse and representative access to effective mental health and wellbeing support efficient and effective provision of workplace adjustments for disabled colleagues Safe to Challenge programme supporting a vibrant, connective, and collaborative staff network group community embedding diversity and inclusion as an essential part of everything that we do The plan is now in its second year of delivery. This year we will open opportunities for internal career progression through our Capacity and Capability programme, designed to fill over 700 vacancies by the end of the 2021/22 financial year continue to develop our Senior Leadership Community focused on inclusive leadership deliver additional hybrid team working line manager support tools which continue to have colleagues\u2019 wellbeing at their heart focus on improving line management capability continue to embed our performance management approach evolve our central workplace adjustments service deliver our Safe to Challenge programme and help establish our Freedom to Speak Up Guardians focus on making progress against our new representation targets deliver our Positive Action Development programme for our most underrepresented groups extend our Team NHSD wellbeing group offer Continuing to deliver inclusion through the pandemic Nobody could predict the impact that the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic would have on all aspects of our lives and work or how long it would last. We've monitored organisational capacity and resilience throughout 2021 and adjusted the actions we've taken accordingly. We continue to put our people and inclusion at the heart of our decision-making and focus on supporting physical, mental and financial wellbeing. In doing so, we are mindful of the uniqueness of individuals\u2019 personal circumstances and take a values-based approach, aiming to promote trust, empathy, empowerment and kindness among all colleagues. We've also taken the opportunity to accelerate breaking down some unhelpful and negative cultural \u2018norms\u2019. Examples of the support we provide include: workplace adjustments for homeworking financial support to facilitate time to care for family responsibilities easy access to mental wellbeing resources and tools training and materials on how to manage and work in inclusive teams remotely regular wellbeing pulse surveys to track and monitor individual and organisation health and wellbeing Our internal talent matters Over the last 18 months, we\u2019ve done an incredible job helping the NHS to save and improve lives. The pandemic and our fantastic response have driven up demand and we are now being asked to deliver much more. We need to significantly grow skills, capacity, and capability to meet our delivery plan which presents us with a unique opportunity to do things differently as we fill these roles. Our guiding principles for this work are to: support and develop internal talent put diversity and inclusion at the centre of recruitment and selection create an environment to retain and attract diverse talent accept this is a very different approach and bring the organisation on the journey ensure that we do not slip back into doing what we have always done Beginning in summer 2021 and running until April 2022, our Capacity and Capability programme will re-write our recruitment and selection rulebook covering everything from how and where we advertise our roles to the way we onboard successful candidates and support unsuccessful candidates. We're implementing a new process with transparent standards that seeks to root out and challenge bias. This is supported by the most comprehensive mandatory assessor training we have ever delivered. We're excited about the opportunities that this programme brings and will monitor the impact through to April 2022, when we aim to have embedded the new practices across all our recruitment and selection. Delivering on our diversity and inclusion priorities Being diverse and representative: what we've done so far Representation rates We agreed bold targets to increase diverse representation across the whole organisation. Transparency We've provided all colleagues access to representation data on-demand via our intranet. Directorates can also view and track their own representation rates. This has resulted in increased business awareness of diversity and inclusion, and the business driving demand for new routes to market to address representation. Recruitment and selection We continued to create a pool of trained assessors that can be deployed to a range of recruitment activities. Improvements to the training and the associated selection tools provides greater quality assurance. The training provides assessors with a deeper knowledge and understanding of the inclusion impacts of fair and consistent recruitment practice. A broader attraction strategy was developed to target underrepresented groups, identifying target networks to engage and build strategic partnerships with. Being diverse and representative: what we're doing next Representation rates Our recruitment and selection processes will be tracked more closely to measure impacts on diverse representation. We will continue to engage with underrepresented groups via recruitment fairs, targeted media and building strategic partnerships. Transparency We will continue to update our diversity and inclusion dashboard to enable colleagues to see how we're doing against the new representation targets. We will also provide regular updates to our Board to ensure accountability. Recruitment and selection Dashboards will be used to track live diversity data available within our recruitment platform, to monitor and review the diversity and inclusion impacts of the process changes. We will gather qualitative and quantitative feedback to evidence this and continuously improve. Access to effective mental health and wellbeing support: what we've done so far Guidance and support We've completed the re-tender of our Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) contract, which incorporates enhanced requirements to address emerging mental wellbeing issues arising from the pandemic and our work on inclusion. We've also brought our Occupational Health (OH) provision together with EAP to take advantage of wellbeing synergies between them. In spring 2021, we launched Team NHSD, an internal wellbeing group facilitated by a personal trainer and wellbeing expert. So far, over 250 colleagues have participated in activities ranging from lunchtime workouts to question and answer sessions and discussing healthy eating. We secured funding to re-launch Team NHSD for a further 12 months from September 2021. Access to effective mental health and wellbeing support: what we're doing next Guidance and support We will continue to promote a broad range of wellbeing support options through a wellbeing matters campaign, along with evolving Team NHSD to broaden its reach and impact throughout 2021/22. Efficient and effective provision of workplace adjustments for disabled colleagues: what we've done so far We've ensured that all workplace adjustments are centrally recorded so that they remain effective and appropriate over time. Including general queries, the adjustment team have supported around 550 cases ranging from pre-employment support to changing needs associated with existing conditions. The support offered includes: provision of display screen equipment and software interview adjustments occupational health referrals and specialist assessments Since October 2020, we've funded approximately \u00a3190,000 of adjustments. We've provided tailored support as part of our move to the Leeds Hub and continued to adapt this as colleagues spend more time in the office. Over 100 colleagues have been supported to transition to the new Leeds building. Our adjustments approach during recruitment has been revised to ensure that candidates can access adjustments from the point of applying, right through to onboarding. Efficient and effective provision of workplace adjustments for disabled colleagues: what we're doing next We will continue to review our adjustments approach, particularly in relation to our new ways of hybrid working. Tailored support will be provided for colleagues affected by our London office move and for National Disease Registration Service (NDRS) colleagues who have joined. We will also assess the impact of our more inclusive recruitment approach on disabled candidates. Safe to Challenge: what we've done so far Response to race inequality We've revisited the events of 2020, including the death of George Floyd, the Black Lives Matter movement and subsequent reaction in the UK, alongside the impact of coronavirus on underrepresented groups \u2013 particularly those from a black, Asian and minority ethnic background \u2013 that brought inclusion and race inequality issues to the fore. We ran 2 more all colleague inclusion events with our partners Pearn Kandola. In the second event, we asked whether we are \u2018still standing by\u2019 and gave colleagues tools and techniques to become active bystanders. We delivered an Inclusive Leadership pilot for our Executive Management Team (EMT) and Senior Leadership Community, in response to the insights gained from our collaborative work with Pearn Kandola and our EMBRACE network. Raising concerns We expanded the ambitions of our Safe to Challenge programme by recruiting and appointing 5 Freedom to Speak Up Guardians. We've appointed subject matter experts from across the business to triage concerns raised through our new platform, launched in October 2021. For the first time in several years, we've surveyed our colleagues on a range of inclusion topics, in particular bullying, harassment and physical safety. Safe to Challenge: what we're doing next Response to race inequality We will use the materials from the \u2018standing by\u2019 event to produce and roll-out a bitesize upskilling session that can be delivered in team meetings. Raising concerns Following the formal launch of our Safe to Challenge initiative in October 2021, which includes activating our 5 Freedom to Speak Up Guardians, we will continue on an education journey including working with colleagues across the business to simplify the entry points for raising concern and updating our intranet pages for easier access and navigation to support. We will also ensure there are reportable Service Level Agreements (SLAs) that we can be held to account for in terms of response, experience and handling of concerns raised. We will review and analyse our inclusion and wellbeing pulse survey results to identify the actions we need to take to ensure everyone feels safe in the workplace. We will launch a complete engagement survey in early 2022 aligned to the national NHS survey. Supporting a vibrant, connective, and collaborative staff network group community: what we've done so far Our staff networks have gone from strength to strength over the last year and adopted a collaborative and intersectional approach. They have each maintained a varied and engaging programme of awareness events, including a series of inspirational guest speakers. Recruited several new chairs, deputies and committee members which has seen many of our networks reinvigorated. We thanked our outgoing chairs with the Going the Extra Mile (GEM) awards to recognise their contributions. Supporting a vibrant, connective, and collaborative staff network group community: what we're doing next We will continue to work in partnership with our staff networks on our growing inclusion agenda and we will also focus on refining a shared set of priorities for the next 12 months, along with launching a refreshed \u2018People Group\u2019 to act as a shadow board. Highlights from our staff networks Open the expanders below to find out about the highlights from our staff networks: EMBRACE Our EMBRACE Network has continued to drive open and challenging conversations and action on racism within NHS Digital. They've worked closely with HR and our inclusion partners Pearn Kandola to show colleagues how to be active bystanders and constructively challenge racist and non-inclusive behaviours. To support colleagues from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds to progress their careers, EMBRACE have fostered a relationship with Fujitsu to run peer coaching sessions. As they do every year, EMBRACE are helping us to celebrate Black History Month with an exciting and engaging programme of events. Ability Network The network\u2019s first Chair, Ellen Doyle, stepped down after 4 years of stewardship that oversaw both membership growth and a significant expansion of the support that the Network offers to both its members and to the organisation\u2019s business areas. Following an open selection, Lisa Swain was appointed Chair last June. Like everyone else, lockdown hit the Ability Network members hard, if not the hardest. This saw a significant increase in the support needed in areas like workplace adjustments, where the network broke new ground in partnership with our central workplace adjustments team by collecting data about existing adjustments in one central place to support both individual needs and business planning. This was such a success that the network helped another NHS organisation implement their methods. In May, the network celebrated Neurodiversity Awareness Week with guest speakers Dr Tony Lloyd, CEO of ADHD Foundation, and Henry Shelford of ADHD UK. They worked collaboratively with other staff networks to reflect intersectionality in the disability arena. Women's Network The Women's Network have gone from strength to strength this year, with a strong focus on supporting the health and wellbeing of its members \u2013 a survey of all members confirmed this was an area they were keen for the network to continue focusing on. This included: partnering with HR colleagues to design and launch a new Menopause Toolkit to help raise awareness and understanding of the impact menopause can have in the workplace and how to support workplace adjustments supporting the development of a new Domestic Abuse Policy helping NHS Digital to secure Endometriosis Friendly Employer status Continuing their wellbeing focus, their events schedule included registered Nutritional Therapist Jackie Lynch talking about nutrition for a happy and healthy menopause, and GP and NHS Menopause Specialist Dr Clare Spencer discussing menopause in the workplace. Gender equality has also been a focus this year with events about the gender pay gap in technology and the Gender Equality Network\u2019s \u2018F\u2019 factor event featuring inspiring women sharing their authentic experiences in the tech world. Multi-faith Network Working in partnership with our estates team, the Multi-faith Network raised awareness of our new quiet spaces and reflection room in the Leeds Hub at Wellington Place by creating video content and user guidance. They raised awareness with an event to share the history and context of the Holocaust and the importance of Holocaust Memorial Day. Throughout the year the network has continued to share information and raise awareness of different beliefs, including an event discussing Humanism as a belief system and its history and context. Family and Carers Network The Family and Carers Network is becoming more established with the expansion of its committee with roles filled on a \u2018job share\u2019 basis. Promoting job sharing and flexible working at all levels and across all directorates is a top priority for the network. They have started an awareness events series to showcase job sharing successes and promote the benefits of different working patterns for individuals and the business. LGBTQ+ and Allies Network This year the network expanded its committee with the addition of Adam Carruthers, an Academy Representative focusing on bringing the voices of early career colleagues into the fold. The biggest success of the year came during NHS Virtual Pride when colleagues from NHS Digital, NatCen and the National LGBT Health Advisor for the NHS presented the results from the Health Survey for England - LGB Health Report to all NHS organisations. Continuing the theme of supporting the health and care sector, the network supported user research activities in the Cancer Screening Programme . They also provided trans awareness training to the NHS login citizen-facing processes for the identity verification staff and worked with the NHS login Delivery Team to implement initial improvements to the user journey for trans people. The LGBTQ+ and Allies Network ran a series of events this year that included numerous guest speakers: Dr Justin Bengry, Director of the Centre for Queer History at Goldsmiths, University of London gave a talk about \u2018The Untold History of the Pink Pound\u2019 during LGBT+ History month: Dr Michael Brady, National Advisor for LGBT Health at NHS England, was invited to speak for Zero Discrimination Day social scientist Dr Marc Svensson held a talk on International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia network Chair, Daniel Gleghorn, shared his experiences of sexuality and religion in our Uncomfortable Conversations series The network made the most impact by championing intersectionality across all protected characteristics. They put together joint events with the Ability Network, EMBRACE and the Women's Network, and more recently the Family and Carers Network. Embedding diversity and inclusion as an essential part of everything that we do What we've done so far During 2020 our \u2018what we do matters\u2019 campaign evolved to encompass \u2018your wellbeing matters\u2019, and finally the inception of \u2018inclusion matters\u2019. The inclusion matters campaign was formally launched with a new visual identity to ensure that our messages about diversity and inclusion stand out within our other communications and activities. What we're doing next We will continue to develop the campaign to highlight the positive steps we are taking towards becoming a truly inclusive place to work. Inclusion survey 2021 This year we took steps to find out more about colleague experiences in relation to bullying, harassment and discrimination. Taking questions used in the NHS Workforce Race Equality Standard and Workforce Disability Equality Standard, we invited colleagues to complete an Inclusion Survey. A total of 1,000 colleagues completed the survey, which is a response rate comparable with similar internal surveys. Many of the issues raised by the survey have been brought to the fore by our staff networks, so the findings will enable us to measure the impact of the preventative measures we are putting in place. In particular, the Safe to Challenge programme, supported by our Freedom to Speak Up Guardians, will play a critical role in helping colleagues to raise concerns and have them addressed. Unfortunately, from the results, it's clear that black, Asian and minority ethnic and disabled colleagues feel their voices are less heard and experience fewer positive inclusion outcomes. This is not acceptable, and we will continue to focus our energy on working hard to change this. Open the expanders below to find out about the headline findings: Representation We invited respondents to complete a protected characteristics declaration for comparison purposes against the Electronic Staff Record (ESR), our core employee records data. 11% of survey respondents identified as disabled as opposed to 5% of colleagues on ESR. Similarly, 9% identified as LGBTQ+ on the survey, compared to 4% on ESR. While it isn\u2019t untypical across organisations for survey declarations to be higher, we will continue to encourage colleagues to feel comfortable sharing their diversity data to enable our baseline to be more accurate. Wellbeing at work In response to the question \u2018Over the last three months have you worked despite not feeling well enough?\u2019, disabled colleagues were more like to say yes (71%) than those who are non-disabled (45%). 9% of all respondents felt pressure from their manager to attend work when not well - this was lower for disabled colleagues (6%) but higher for those from black, Asian and minority ethnic groups (11%). The results report that pressure to work while unwell was higher from colleagues than from managers: 25% of disabled colleagues felt this compared with 13% of those non-disabled, and 19% of black, Asian and minority ethnic groups, compared with 14% white. 17% of men compared with 14% of women felt pressure from colleagues to work while unwell. Compared to all respondents (91%), self-pressure to come to work when unwell ranged from 71% for black, Asian and minority ethnic colleagues, to 94% for disabled colleagues. Career development There were significant differences between groups responding positively to the question \u2018Do you believe NHS Digital acts fairly with regard to career progression?\u2019. Ranging from all respondents (60%) to women (53%), disabled colleagues (35%) and black, Asian and minority ethnic groups (33%). Harassment, bullying and discrimination We asked questions to understand how many colleagues had experienced harassment, bullying and discrimination and on what frequency. We found that: 3% was experienced from service users, with 22 people saying 1 or 2 occasions compared to 13% experienced from colleagues black, Asian and minority ethnic and disabled colleagues reported higher rates, 17% and 26%, respectively around a third of women, black, Asian and minority ethnic and disabled colleagues reported it compared with a quarter of men, white and non-disabled sex, age, race, and disability were the most common types of discrimination; over a third of respondents had experienced more than one type of discrimination there were 5 reports of physical violence at work (3 by managers, 2 by colleagues, 1 by a service user), which we take very seriously and are investigating further with planned support from the Guardians Last edited: 17 February 2022 4:26 pm Previous Chapter Why we report Next Chapter A look at the diversity of our workforce today Chapters Annual inclusion report 2021-22 Welcome Why we report Our diversity and inclusion journey continues A look at the diversity of our workforce today Our pay gaps Workforce Race Equality Standard (WRES) Workforce Disability Equality Standard (WDES) Creating the best and most inclusive place to work The data behind the decisions",

Other diversity categories, such as LGB+, with smaller numbers of declarations have not been presented due to disclosure controls and the potentially misleading impact of small numbers on headline figures. Gender pay gap Trends Analysis of the data shows: our mean gender pay gap, currently 9.4%, has decreased by 7 percentage points since 2017 the median pay gap, currently 11.4%, after remaining static for a couple of years has decreased 2 percentage points in the last year Impact The gender pay gap continues to be impacted by levels of basic pay and the differences in senior representation, followed by allocation of Recruitment Retention Premium (RRP) and distribution of on call pay. There may be small variations in the data set of the report for 2021 compared to those from previous years. If the differences in the data were removed, the same conclusions would be made from the analysis. 9.4% mean pay gap For every \u00a31 that the average man earned, the average woman earned \u00a30.91 11.4% median pay gap For every \u00a31 that the median man earned, the median woman earned \u00a30.89 Download the data for this chart Gender pay gap trend In consultation with our LGBTQ+ staff network we have agreed that where binary male/female categories are referenced this represents sex (i.e., assigned at birth) as opposed to a gender identity (e.g. cis gender, non-binary, gender fluid etc). We are working towards improving how we represent gender identities within our inclusion data and hope to share further developments within future annual reports. Ethnicity pay gap Trends Analysis of the data shows: our mean ethnicity pay gap is 7.8%, showing a continued decrease since 2017 the median pay gap is 8.7%, having risen since 2017, but has increased less than 1 percentage point this year Impact The ethnicity pay gap is impacted by levels of basic pay and the differences in senior representation, followed by allocation of RRP and distribution of on call pay. The higher proportion of black, Asian and minority ethnic staff being based in London is reflected in the positive effect London weighting allowance has on the overall pay gap. There may be small variations in the data set of the report for 2021, compared to those from previous years. If the differences in the data were removed, the same conclusions would be made from the analysis. 7.8% mean pay gap For every \u00a31 that the average white colleague earned, the average black, Asian and minority ethnic colleague earned \u00a30.92 8.7% median pay gap For every \u00a31 that the median white colleague earned, the median black, Asian and minority ethnic colleague earned \u00a30.91 Download the data for this chart Ethnicity pay gap trend Disability pay gap Trends Analysis of the data shows: our mean disability pay gap has increased more than a percentage point in the last year the median pay gap has also increased more than a percentage point in the last year Impact The disability pay gap is impacted by basic pay. Notably the proportion of staff declaring a disability and in receipt of additional pay such as RRP and London weighting allowance and on call pay is much lower than that for non-disabled colleagues, women and black, Asian and minority ethnicities. It should also be noted that non-disclosure rates are higher within the more senior pay bands. Lower disclosure rates and lower representation within more senior pay bands lead to lower average basic pay. There may be small variations in the data set of the report for 2021 compared to those from previous years. If the differences in the data were removed, the same conclusions would be made from the analysis. 9.3% mean pay gap For every \u00a31 that the average person with no stated disability earned, the average disabled person earned \u00a30.91 6.9% median pay gap For every \u00a31 that the median person with no stated disability earned, the average disabled person earned \u00a30.93 Download the data for this chart Disability pay gap trend Challenging questions for our action plan To better understand our pay gaps and to help inform our action plans, we've posed ourselves a series of challenging questions. Do people get \u2018stuck\u2019 at certain levels within the organisation? The analysis indicates that disabled colleagues stay at the top of their pay band significantly longer than colleagues who declare they do not have a disability. Tenure at the top of the band for black, Asian and minority ethnic colleagues shows a different pattern to that of white colleagues. More black, Asian and minority ethnic colleagues spend up to 3 years at the top of the band and significantly fewer spending 4 or more years (31% compared with 48%). A slightly higher proportion of women than men spend one year at the top of their band, and a slightly higher proportion of men spend four years or more at the top of the band. Is there an imbalance in who gets promoted? Promotion and acting up rates for disabled and black, Asian and minority ethnic colleagues are lower, suggesting that there may be barriers to career progression. Employees who have been promoted while acting up are included in the overall promoted figures. Ethnicity Promotion and acting up rates are comparable with the overall organisational representation rate, however, below the published target rate of 19%. Disability Overall declaration rates for disability are low, however the data indicates that disabled colleagues are underrepresented by half within acting up roles. A similar pattern is evident in relation to promotions. There is higher representation of women in acting up roles, but this is not being translated into permanent promotions. Women are underrepresented by approximately half when compared to men and in comparison, to the organisation representation rate for women. Are some groups more likely to be recruited to lower paid roles? There's been a slight increase in the proportion of disabled staff in the lower pay bands, however overall representation is broadly proportionate across all bands. Attraction and selection of disabled candidates is low, and it is notable that there have not been any appointments to senior grades. It should be noted that declaration rates are particularly low for disability, particularly during recruitment. Black, Asian and minority ethnic colleagues are disproportionately underrepresented within the lowest pay bands. However, percentage success rates in recruitment at middle and senior management level have been mostly maintained or proportionately slightly increased from the previous year. There's an overall 12.1% of recruitment success rate when averaged across all bands, which is lower than the target rate. There were relatively equal numbers of men and women appointed to junior grades. Do some aspects of pay (bonus/starting salary/additional payments) differ? The biggest cause of the mean pay gap was the basic pay factor, largely due to a small number of colleagues declaring a disability occupying the more senior pay grades in comparison to those with no declared disability. The London weighting allowance was the only factor found to reduce the pay gap apart from RRP in 2021. The basic pay factor contributes to 9.1% of the 9.3% pay gap. There's a higher proportion of black, Asian and minority ethnic colleagues based in London, where they receive a high-cost area supplement which has a positive effect on the pay gap. The basic pay factor is 8.3% and the impact of the London weighting allowance was to reduce the mean ethnicity pay gap by 1.1 percentage points and this impact has remained consistent with previous years. The mean ethnicity pay gap is 7.8%. Far more men than women are in roles that receive RRP and on call premiums which increases the pay gap. RRP contributes 1.2% to the mean gender pay gap while on call contributes to 0.6%. This is consistent with previous years. Basic pay factor is the biggest contributor to the pay gap, and this has decreased by 7 percentage points since 2017, from contributing 15.2% to a 16.6% mean pay gap in 2017 to 8% of a 9.4% mean pay gap in 2021. Do different groups leave at different rates? Black, Asian and minority ethnic colleagues left NHS Digital at higher comparable rates to white colleagues in all band ranges apart from senior management. Disabled colleagues left at a comparable rate to non-disabled colleagues respectively.

Valuing diversity and creating an inclusive environment allows us to build a workforce that better represents health and care staff and the communities we serve, which will enable us to develop and deliver better products and services, and ultimately enable improved health care outcomes. Challenging representation targets We are proud of the progress we have made so far but recognise we have much more to do to create the best and most inclusive place to work. We know that we have not seen a significant shift in NHS Digital\u2019s workforce diversity over the past 4 to 5 years. We also know that we need to be bold, unapologetic, and relentless in our approach to achieve our ambition. To help visibly drive change, our Board has set new challenging representation targets to encourage greater diversity and inclusion at all levels, and to make NHS Digital a truly inclusive environment by 2025. Actions speak louder than words As you will see in this report, we are continuing to deliver many of the inclusion commitments we set out in our People Plan. We know that actions speak louder than words and we are making a deliberate and concerted effort across a range of available levers. Over the next 12 months we are focusing on: making iterative improvements to our attraction and selection processes to ensure they are transparent and inclusive strengthening inclusive leadership accountability ensuring open, fair, and transparent processes, including internal promotion and development programmes, and external recruitment and selection improving outreach and engagement with underrepresented groups in local communities and the wider labour market to promote NHS Digital as an inclusive employer focusing on the diversity in our pipeline and feeder band recruitment, for example graduates, apprentices, and school leavers increasing declaration rates internally for existing staff, building confidence on how we use the data, and externally through the recruitment processes, better explaining why we capture data through selection and onboarding giving real consideration and practical use of positive action, as permitted by the Equality Act 2010, for development opportunities and in recruitment - this is different from positive discrimination, which is illegal fostering a greater sense of belonging to drive engagement and improved satisfaction levels of existing colleagues from underrepresented groups to positively impact leavers statistics building greater awareness of discrimination and tackling the challenges we have through continued education on issues such as microaggressions, bystander behaviours, diversity, and inclusion development with senior teams We will continue to listen, learn and understand perspectives from all of our colleagues, with the help of our 7 staff networks , to ensure they feel supported and able to thrive. Our ambition is to make NHS Digital the best and most inclusive place to work by creating an environment where colleagues feel that they can perform to their full potential, regardless of background, identity, or circumstances. We want everyone in our organisation to feel valued, that they belong and that their contribution matters. Best, Simon Bolton, Interim Chief Executive, NHS Digital.

The WDES differs from the WRES in that it includes a qualitative evidence questionnaire that looks at the interventions in place to address inequality. Trends The current data we have available in relation to 4 of 5 of the indicators during 2020-21 shows: overall workforce % by disability overall declaration rates have decreased slightly from 5.2% to 5.1%. Headcount numbers at lower bands have remained stable, however there has been a decrease in numbers at band 8A and above relative likelihood of non-disabled staff being appointed from shortlisting compared to disabled staff has decreased from 0.76 to 0.24 (where 1.00 indicates parity). The non-declaration rate remains extremely high which impacts the validity of this statistic relative likelihood of disabled staff entering the formal disciplinary process compared to non-disabled staff decreased from 0.75 to 0.593 (where 1.00 indicates parity). It must be noted that the very low numbers (less than 2) involved in this indicator make it sensitive relative likelihood of disabled staff accessing non-mandatory training and CPD compared to non-disabled staff has decreased slightly from 1.01 to 1.00 (where 1.00 indicates parity) Impact The declaration data indicates that NHS Digital employment of disabled people is significantly below the rates within the wider population (5% versus 12%). When considered alongside the decline in appointment rates and headcount data there is serious cause for concern. However, declaration rates do not necessarily provide accurate data relating to the actual percentage of disabled staff in NHS Digital. We will continue to work to increase colleagues\u2019 confidence in declaring disability status in order to improve the reliability of this data.

The final report will be due for publication in Spring 2022. There were previously 9 indicators. However, NHS England have changed the data collection requirements this year, meaning that data on previous indicators 5 to 8 are no longer being collected. Trends The current data we have available in relation to 4 of 5 of the indicators during 2020-21: overall workforce % by ethnicity decreased from 13.4% to 13.0%, and there was also an increase in unknown ethnicity from 9.0% to 10% relative likelihood of white staff being appointed from shortlisting compared to black, Asian and minority ethnic staff increased from 1.59 to 2.62 (where 1.00 indicates parity) relative likelihood of black, Asian and minority ethnic staff entering the formal disciplinary process compared to white staff increased from 1.74 to 1.97 (where 1.00 indicates parity) relative likelihood of white staff accessing non-mandatory training and CPD compared to black, Asian and minority ethnic staff had moved from 0.99 to 0.96, which means a near equal likelihood for both black, Asian and minority ethnic and white staff (a value of 1.00 indicates parity) Impact Our data indicates that there are unacceptable disparities between the experiences of black, Asian and other minority ethnicities and those of white colleagues. Improving the relatively low declaration rates for ethnicity is a priority to ensure that we are able to assess the full impact of our people processes. Reviewing our corporate processes for recruiting, developing, and dealing with formal HR issues to identify and design out bias will be critical to preventing disparities in the future.

As we transition to the \u2018new\u2019 NHS England the graph below illustrates the current overall gap at organisation level. he diversity data and information reported in this graph is based on the period April 2021 to September 2022. Characteristics broken down by pay band The following data was taken from the Electronic Staff Record (ESR) system for the period April 2021 to September 2022 and is a snapshot of the employee population at a particular point in time. When our protected characteristics are further broken down by grade, the picture changes, and the following trends are evident. In March 2021, there was re-grading of the medical staff moving to standardised pay scales. This resulted in significantly fewer number of staff on personal salaries, compared to previous years, which has resulted in higher percentages presented in the visuals below. Female representation has increased in percentage points since 2018 in the following bands: bands 7, 8A-8D and 9.

Download the data for this chart Disability representation by pay band We recognise that like many other organisations and the NHS, more broadly, there is a general lack of diversity within the senior grades. We know that barriers to career progression and lack of representative role models are among the influential factors here. Therefore, as we move to the \u2018new\u2019 NHS England, continuing a strong organisational commitment to diversity targets and their associated actions is very critical.

The information is sourced from: the Electronic Staff Record (ESR) warehouse system, which holds our staff data NHS Jobs - a recruitment website we use for our vacancies our 2017 Employee Engagement Survey Between 1 April 2016 and 31 March 2017: 349 new appointments were made 8,680 job applications were received 298 staff left the business Choose a demographic group: Gender Gender pay Age Disability Sexual orientation Ethnicity Religion or belief Marriage and civil partnership Pregnancy and maternity Gender reassignment Gender The gender composition of the workforce is similar to last year and may reflect our high number of traditionally male roles, such as IT. The data also showed that: more women than men were employed at bands 4 to 6 - this pattern reverses from band 7 upwards men make up nearly three quarters of band 9 roles (74% to 26%), but more women than men were appointed to band 9 roles in 2016/17 57.9% of 2016/17 appointments were men and 42.1% women - this is similar to the proportion of applications made and in line with the current workforce more women were appointed at bands 4 to 6 and more than two thirds appointed to bands 7 to 8d were men there was nearly an equal gender split of those applying for posts in the NHS Digital Academy, which focuses on early careers 24% of women work part time, compared to 5% of men 53% of leavers were men and 47% women, which is similar to the workforce profile Find out more gender information. Gender pay Download a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the gender pay gap within NHS Digital since March 2017. Women's mean and median pay (hourly rate) is lower than males. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates that the gender pay gap (median earnings) is 18.1%. NHS Digital is currently below this at 14.1%. The quartile pay bands demonstrate how the male and female split changes the higher up the organisation employees progress. Women (44% of the current workforce) have the highest representation at quartile A (58%) and the lowest representation at quartile D (31%). We use the national Agenda for Change job evaluation scheme to evaluate all new posts. Find out what's included in this information. Age The majority of employees are aged between 35 and 54 years. This may reflect the high amount of senior roles and the time required to gain this experience. We also found that: the largest group of job applicants were in the age group 30 to 39 years (35.1%) the largest group appointed were aged 35 to 44 years (34.1%), closely followed by 25 to 34 years (29.9%) - these groups also had the highest level of turnover at 29% (25 to 34 years) and 27% (35 to 44 years) most roles advertised were band 5 and above and required degree level experience 70% of 16 to 25 year olds who responded to the staff survey and declared their age feel that NHS Digital as a whole is managed well, whereas 45% of 46 to 55 year olds disagree with this statement Find out more age information. Disability The percentage of employees whose disability status was not disclosed or unknown has fallen from just over 55% to 24%, reflecting NHS Digital's efforts to improve the quality of data held. The report also showed that: 4.8% of job applicants and 4.2% of appointed employees declared a disability - this figure is similar to the overall workforce profile 93.2% of job applicants did not have a declared disability, which reduced to 73.1% at the appointment stage - 1.9% of job applicants chose not to disclose their disability status 8% of total leavers declared a disability - this is above the current workforce profile (5%) scores against each question in the staff survey were generally lower for those with a stated disability An external review of the Disability Confident scheme has taken place and was re-accredited last year. Find out more disability information. Sexual orientation Our data shows that: 23% of the workforce chose not to disclose their sexual orientation and 3% were unknown - this decreased from nearly 50% last year 3.3% of job applications were from LGB candidates, and 2.8% of appointments were LGB - this is similar to the current workforce 88.2% of job applicants were heterosexual, and this reduced to 72.3% at the appointment stage 2% of leavers identified as LGB, which is in line with the workforce Find out more sexual orientation information. Ethnicity BAME - Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic. Our job applications are anonymised and shortlisted based on knowledge, skills and experience to eliminate opportunities for unconscious bias. Our data showed that: 9% of employees did not state their ethnic origin. This is a reduction from 2015/16, when it was 17% 38.5% of job applications were from BAME candidates, and 12.7% of appointments were BAME 56.7% of applications and 71.5% of appointments were White in general, employees that declared their ethnicity as Asian or Asian British responded more positively than other groups within the staff survey (this is based on low numbers) employees that declared their ethnicity as Asian or Asian British were more positive than other groups in the employee survey in regards to having a voice (this is based on low numbers) 10% of leavers were BAME, which is below the BAME workforce (13%) Find out more ethnicity information. Religion or belief The largest religious belief is Christianity at 36% and 20% of staff were Atheist. We also found that: 28% of employees did not wish to disclose their religious belief and 3% of employees had an unknown religious belief, compared to over 50% for these groups last year of 361 appointed staff in 2016/2017, 30.2% had a religious belief of Christianity, 3.9% of Islam and 26.3% were Atheist 28.3% of appointed staff chose not to disclose their religious belief - 3% of appointed staff had an unknown religious belief 40.1% of job applicants had a religious belief of Christianity, 12.4% of Islam and 16.7% were Atheist - 13.3% of job applicants had an undisclosed religious belief 26% of leavers had a religious belief of Christianity and 10% were Atheist 23% of leavers chose not to disclose their religious belief and 33% of leavers had an unknown religious belief Marriage and civil partnership Our data for marriage and civil partnerships shows that: 1,304 (46%) of employees were married, 18 (1%) in a civil partnership and 813 (29%) single 7% of employees have chosen not to provide a specific marital status, whilst the marital status of 11% of employees is undefined 44.3% of job applicants were single and 44.1% were married 46.3% of appointed staff were married and 42.7% were single Our policies seek to ensure that employees are not discriminated against on the grounds of being married or in a civil partnership. Pregnancy or maternity NHS Digital's maternity leave policy ensures a focus on an individual's needs during pregnancy and maternity periods. Other support options include: flexible working special leave parental leave shared parental leave time off for antenatal classes Gender reassignment Data on gender reassignment is not currently recorded on ESR. NHS England are currently leading a piece of work to develop consistent national data standards relating to all aspects of the protected characteristics for the NHS, including gender reassignment. Once completed, it will be implemented in ESR and any changed or additional details will be reported by NHS Digital. Find out more about our data. Last edited: 21 January 2019 9:14 am",

      "content": "Anti-fraud, bribery, and corruption We're a publicly-funded organisation, committed to applying the highest standards of ethical conduct and behaviour. We have robust controls to prevent fraud, bribery and corruption. Page contents Management statement The Bribery Act 2010 came into effect on 1st July 2011 with the aim of tackling bribery and corruption in both the private and public sectors. Bribery is generally defined as the giving or receiving of a financial or other advantage in exchange for improperly performing a relevant function or activity. The maximum penalty for bribery is 10 years imprisonment, with an unlimited fine. NHS Digital is a publicly funded organisation and is committed to applying the highest standards of ethical conduct and behaviour which includes having robust controls in place to prevent fraud, bribery and corruption. However, as an organisation we cannot afford to be complacent and under no circumstances is the giving, offering, receiving or soliciting of a bribe acceptable and NHS Digital therefore adopts a zero tolerance approach to all forms. In order to minimise the risk of unfounded allegations of bribery or corruption, if staff are offered hospitality or gifts or are considering offering any to another person they should refer to current policy for details of the circumstances in which this would be acceptable and the level which can be given or received; advice can be sought from Corporate Services if required. Staff are reminded that all hospitality and gifts received, offered or declined should be declared using the form accessible from the policy and eStore. Staff members with suspicions that fraud, bribery or corruption might be taking place should report it to the NHS Digital Fraud Manager fraud.manager@nhs.net. Further details on how to raise a concern can be found in the Anti-Fraud, Bribery and Corruption Policy. Reports can also be made anonymously and further information is contained within the whistleblowing policy. NHS Digital expects its suppliers and those working on its behalf, to adhere to these standards and may seek to terminate contracts with any suppliers found by a court of law to have been guilty of corruption. The success of the organisation\u2019s anti-fraud, bribery and corruption measures depends on all employees, and those acting for the organisation playing their part in helping to prevent, detect and deter fraud, bribery and corruption. Carl Vincent Chief Financial Officer Reporting fraud, bribery or corruption Staff members who suspect fraud, bribery or corruption may be taking place should report it to either of the following: NHS Digital\u2019s Fraud Manager Email: fraud.manager@nhs.net Telephone: 0113 397 4321 or 07920 232 745 Fraud and Corruption Reporting Line, Crimestoppers Telephone: 0800 028 40 60 This is a dedicated freephone number, open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. You can report anonymously if you wish. Whistleblowing Definition Whistleblowing is when an employee notifies their employer, professional regulator, customers, the police or the media about a dangerous or illegal activity in their workplace. Examples of such activities include: fraud, bribery or corruption, unlawful conduct, financial malpractice, breaches of codes of conduct, disregard for health and safety rules, dangers to the public or the environment or any other similar matter. Advice Anyone concerned about a wrongdoing that threatens the public interest and is unsure of whether they want to raise the matter through official channels can seek free, independent and confidential legal advice from the charity Public Concern at Work .

      "content": "Gifts and hospitality policy Page contents What is this policy about? The Gifts and Hospitality policy is a core part of our overall Code of Business Conduct for all colleagues. Together with our other key corporate policies it guides us in how to preserve our reputation and live our values. This policy covers how you should act when it comes to the provision and / or receipt of hospitality and/or the receipt or provision of gifts while working for NHS Digital. Remember, if you don\u2019t comply with this policy, you could face disciplinary action from NHS Digital or your employer. If you are not directly employed by NHS Digital, your placement, secondment, or other arrangement could be ended. Who does it cover? The Code covers everyone who works for us, or with us. That include full or part-time, temporary, or interim roles working at any level of the organisation. It also covers anyone working on behalf of NHS Digital as a contractor, supplier, or consultant. All the above are referred to as \u201ccolleagues\u201d throughout this policy. What you need to do If you are offered or provide any gift or hospitality \u2013 whether accepted or not \u2013 you must declare and record it using the declaration of gifts and hospitality eForm . You need to declare any gifts and hospitality during your business for NHS Digital, except those of minimal value. You should only accept or provide hospitality when you can show it is in NHS Digital\u2019s interest. That might be helping with a key business aim or to build relationships for a clear business goal, but it should not lead to potential concerns for your reputation or that of NHS Digital. Be aware Transparency is essential, especially in your dealings with suppliers \u2013 your decision making should never be seen to generate influence. The guiding principle is that staff must not accept gifts, hospitality or other benefits of any kind which might be seen to compromise their personal or professional integrity, and that they make all necessary declarations in accordance with this policy. If you are unsure, please refer to the Code of Business Conduct Policy and or Register of Interests Policy. If you remain unsure about whether you should offer or accept a gift, hospitality, or other benefits you must seek advice from your line manager, executive director, or the Head of Corporate Governance. What\u2019s acceptable? If you attend hospitality that is more lavish than you were made aware of beforehand \u2013 and if refusing it would be rude or embarrass anyone \u2013 you should accept it. But you must declare it immediately on your return to work. You can accept any hospitality that is modest and reasonable in the circumstances without recording it. Be aware You may provide lunch for any work visitors, but you must not claim subsistence allowances for it. What\u2019s unacceptable? The following examples of hospitality are unacceptable in any circumstances: a holiday abroad use of a company or private house, flat or hotel suite invitations to entertainment or sporting events attendance at awards ceremonies which are not approved and seen as fit for the business by an executive director Be aware To be fully transparent, you should still record any offers of hospitality, even if you declined it. Gifts Acceptance of any gift offered must be justified. In general, gifts should be refused to avoid the appearance of improper influence. You can accept items that are trivial, inexpensive, or reasonable and proportionate, such as: low value \u2018promotional\u2019 gifts (such calendars, diaries, or items up to the value of \u00a310) conventional personal gifts \u2013 such as flowers, fruit, or sweets low value gifts to be shared by your team such as sweets or cakes Be aware Make sure you report these gifts straight away using the declaration of gifts and hospitality eForm . You should return any unreasonably generous gift quickly, with a letter politely explaining our policy and that NHS Digital cannot accept it. If the gift cannot be returned, such as perishables, your line manager may decide whether it can be shared among colleagues, given to charity, or kept by you. You should write to the person who sent it to let them know what you did with it. Commercial sponsorship You may attend commercially sponsored conferences or courses at the sponsor\u2019s expense, except where it could be seen to potentially compromise our purchasing decisions. To attend these events, you need the agreement of your Executive Director (or for EMT members, the Chief Financial Officer or Chief Executive Officer) before you accept. You should also record the event using the declaration of gifts and hospitality eForm . Be aware You should refer to the register of interests policy and the commercial policy before you decide to attend such events. Hospitality Hospitality you provide on behalf of the organisation to representatives of other organisations should always be modest and appropriate. Once it is agreed, you should record it using the declaration of gifts and hospitality eForm . Meetings / training For meetings or training courses solely for colleagues, you should keep hospitality to light refreshments only. You should always get permission from a senior colleague in the business area providing the hospitality, by setting out your business case and the expected benefits from the event in writing. Our official events For official events hosted by NHS Digital such as conference and seminars, provision of food and refreshment should be requested through corporate services via the Buffet Request form who will ensure costs are recorded to demonstrate best value for money. Off-site events Any official off-site hospitality you provide should not look to match or exceed hospitality you have received. These should be exceptional cases and, where possible, the event should be agreed in advance from the relevant executive director. Be aware Any emails you send to make a business case or for approvals should be attached when you complete your declaration of gifts and hospitality eForm . Office hospitality You can provide working lunches at our official meeting venues when they unavoidably take place for a minimum four hours and through the hours of midday to 2pm. Lunches as part of NHS Digital training courses for external participants are acceptable. Special occasions Special occasions include one-off events where you may provide refreshments. These might be held to open a building, launch a new service, or recognise excellence by a group of colleagues. They should be strictly justified by management and meet a cost limit. If you host social events such as retirements, birthdays, or office parties they should be funded by you and your colleagues. Refreshments at office meetings with external delegates At any formal meetings which run for at least three hours you can provide light refreshments such as: tea and coffee from any free of charge stocks available in NHS Digital offices stock you requested through office services from an on-site caterer where it is the only option Be aware You may not claim reimbursement for refreshments you supply personally. How we keep records NHS Digital keeps a central register of all gifts and hospitality records, managed by our Governance and Compliance team. All colleagues should use the declaration of gifts and hospitality eForm to record any gifts and hospitality as described in this policy. You may also want to keep your own record. If you can\u2019t be sure of the exact value of the hospitality you record, it\u2019s still important to record a realistic estimate. Be aware The information we need for the declaration form may change from time to time. You should always record gifts and hospitality as soon as possible. We do an annual audit of the hospitality register to: review the number and sources of the entries analyse the value of hospitality and the gifts that were offered but declined analyse the hospitality and gifts that were accepted look at the value and nature of the hospitality we provided see which outside organisations offered hospitality and gifts see which outside organisations received hospitality Last edited: 24 March 2022 2:36 pm",

Current Chapter Digital inclusion for health and social care View all Next Chapter What digital inclusion is Page contents Important messages The NHS, and the wider health and care system, is committed to delivering information and services digitally wherever appropriate. For patients, digital health can mean better access to information and care, increased convenience, and more opportunities for greater control of their own health and shared care. For the health and care system digital health can mean more effective delivery of care, better outcomes and reduced costs. However many of the people who could most benefit from digital services are the least likely to be online. Eleven million people (20% of the population of the UK) lack basic digital skills, or do not use digital technology at all. These are likely to be older, less educated and in poorer health than the rest of the population. Local health and care services should take into account the needs of people who may be digitally excluded. There is a strong business case for the benefits of improving digital inclusion. Health and care organisations can work with a range of community partners to improve digital inclusion. This guide includes a range of resources which can help commissioners and providers to take action locally. Who this guide is for This guide to digital inclusion is aimed at local health and care organisations to help them to take practical steps increase access to digital services for all in their communities. It should be relevant to: commissioners of health and care services, including clinical commissioning groups \u2013 so they can take into account the needs of local populations who may be digitally excluded integrated care systems \u2013 so they can ensure digital inclusion is central to the design of future services providers of health and care services \u2013 so they can ensure services delivered digitally are as inclusive as possible local authorities and voluntary organisations \u2013 so they can make the most of partnerships with the health and care sector to improve digital inclusion designers of digital health services \u2013 so they can take into account the needs of those who might be digitally excluded, and design inclusive and accessible services How this guide can help The guide is intended to help you understand: what we mean by digital inclusion who is likely to be digitally excluded and the barriers they may face why digital inclusion matters in health and care the benefits of supporting people to get online practical steps you can take to support digital inclusion locally the tools you can use to commission, provide and evaluate digital inclusion support resources for developing digital skills of health and care staff, carers and patients Download the digital inclusion guide for health and social care Digital inclusion guide for health and social care [Archive content] pdf 2 MB Last edited: 7 September 2022 4:27 pm Next Chapter What digital inclusion is Chapters Digital inclusion for health and social care What we mean by digital inclusion Why digital inclusion matters to health and social care How we can support digital inclusion Designing for inclusion Who we can work with How digital inclusion transforms lives: case studies Links and resources",

But the concept of accessibility doesn\u2019t just apply to people with disabilities - all users will have different needs at different times and in different circumstances. Someone\u2019s ability to use a service could be affected by their: location - they could be in a noisy cafe, sunny park or area with slow wi-fi health - they may be tired, recovering from a stroke or have a broken arm equipment - they could be on a mobile phone or using an older browser Accessibility is about making sure your service can be used by as many people as possible. Thinking about this from the beginning will help you: make sure that nobody is excluded find out earlier if any parts of your service aren\u2019t accessible Whether you are building or commissioning an online service, there are tools and standards available to ensure the service is accessible to everyone. You can: use the NHS digital service manual for things you need to consider to make consistent digital services draw on web accessibility guidelines such as the web content accessibility checklist to ensure online services conform to Level AA standards use online accessibility checklists such as WAVE to give a quick view of how accessible your services are read the GOV.UK guidance on making your service accessible and designing for different browsers and devices view this video from Citizens Online on making technology work for everyone Accessibility doesn\u2019t just apply to people with disabilities - all users will have different needs at different times and in different circumstances Accessible Information Standard All organisations that supply NHS care or publicly funded adult social care are legally required to follow the accessible information standard . The standard sets out a specific, consistent approach to identifying, recording, flagging, sharing and meeting the information and communication support needs of patients, service users, carers and parents with a disability, impairment or sensory loss. Accessibility software Texthelp works closely with over 60 NHS organisations currently, helping make websites and digital platforms more accessible to all. Case studies such as Bridgewater Community Healthcare Trust and Guys and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust, show how NHS organisations are using assistive software to make digital services more accessible. Design principles for digital inclusion Through service design work in Widening Digital Participation pathfinders a set of principles are being developed for designing for digital inclusion: Go to where people are Work with the people who know them best Co-design: from initial discovery phase to live service and beyond Build solutions that fit into people\u2019s everyday lives Use existing tools and resources wherever possible Outcomes first, then digital Watch your language NHS design principles The NHS has produced a digital service manual with a set of design principles .

Digital inclusion: improving access - Rob Webster, Chief Executive, South West Yorkshire Partnership NHS Trust talks about how digital inclusion is making a real difference to mental health service users. Digital inclusion: social prescribing - Sir Sam Everington, GP and Chair of Tower Hamlets Clinical Commissioning Group, talks about social prescribing at the Bromley-by-Bow Centre. Digital inclusion: long-term conditions - Dr Ruth Chambers, GP and Clinical Telehealth Lead at Stoke-on-Trent Clinical Commissioning Group, talks about how local clinical commissioning groups are taking on board digital inclusion. Digital inclusion and health inequalities The NHS long term plan makes a commitment to a more concerted and systematic approach to reducing health inequalities and addressing unwarranted variation in care. In today\u2019s society, digital exclusion can be seen as a form of inequality. There is a close correlation between digital exclusion and social disadvantages including lower income, lower levels of education, and poor housing. Health inequalities should be addressed in the local plans being developed in response to the national Long Term Plan. In an increasingly digital world, people who are digitally excluded are at risk of worse access to services and worse health outcomes. People who have characteristics that are protected under the Equality Act 2010 (age, disability, race) are less likely to have access to the internet, and the skills to use it. Health and care organisations should take this into account when carrying out Equality Impact Assessments (EqIAs). Policy commitments Important commitments to digital inclusion have been made in recent policies, including: NHS long term plan \u201cPeople will be empowered, and their experience of health and care will be transformed, by the ability to access, manage and contribute to digital tools, information and services. We will ensure these technologies work for everyone, from the most digitally literate to the most technology averse, and reflect the needs of people trying to stay healthy as well as those with complex conditions\u201d. The future of healthcare \u201cDifferent people may need different services and some people will never use digital services themselves directly but will benefit from others using digital services and freeing resources to help them. We must acknowledge that those with the greatest health needs are also the most at risk of being left behind and build digital services with this in mind, ensuring the highest levels of accessibility wherever possible\u201d. Preparing the healthcare workforce to deliver the digital future (Topol Review) \u201cThe NHS is founded on a commitment to the principles of equal and equitable access to healthcare for all UK citizens. Yet use of digital healthcare technologies could undermine these principles by exacerbating inequalities, unless consideration is given to how they affect equality and equity, including the risk that vulnerable groups might be excluded or exploited\u201d. Benefits of digital health When considering the business case, there is increasing evidence of the benefits of digital health . The benefits to patients and carers include: improved self-care for minor ailments improved self-management of long-term conditions improved take-up of digital health tools and services time saved through accessing services digitally cost saved through accessing services digitally reduced loneliness and isolation And benefits for the health and care system, including: lower cost of delivering services digitally more appropriate use of services, including primary care and urgent care better patient adherence to medicines and treatments Those who are digitally excluded risk missing out on the benefits to individuals of digital health. And the health and care system will not save money and transform services unless it engages with the one in five of their population who are not online or have digital skills \u2013 and are the heaviest users of health and care. Those who are digitally excluded risk missing out on the benefits. Evaluation of Widening Digital Participation Evaluation of Phase One of the NHS Widening Digital Participation programme provides the most detailed analysis of the impact of increasing digital inclusion on health. Of those who were supported by the programme: 59% felt more confident in using online health information 52% feel less lonely or isolated 21% have had less visits to their GP for minor ailments 22% have progressed to booking GP appointments online and 20% to ordering prescriptions online 39% have saved time through carrying out health transactions online This evaluation estimates a return on investment of \u00a36.40 for every \u00a31.00 spent by the NHS on digital inclusion support. Read the evaluation report in full here. Benefits for society and return on investment Increasing digital inclusion has benefits for society as a whole as well as for the NHS. It is important to take these benefits into consideration when considering the impacts for public health. A 2014 report from BT on valuing digital inclusion calculated the social return on investment (SROI) of digital inclusion for individuals and for workers. For individuals, getting online is worth \u00a31,064 a year due to increased confidence, less social isolation, financial savings and opportunities in employment and leisure. For workers, getting online is worth \u00a33,568 a year due to opportunities for remote working and increased earnings opportunities. A 2016 analysis of Scottish data carried out by Ipsos MORI for Carnegie UK Trust illustrates how the wider societal benefits of internet use is associated with better health and wellbeing . Those who use the internet are more likely to have been to a cultural event, visited the outdoors for recreation, taken part in sport or volunteered. Conversely those who are not online are more likely to have visited their doctor once a month or more. Downsides While there are significant benefits, remember that being online can also have downsides. Some people have been scammed or victims of cyber-crime. Others (particularly young people) have been victims of online bullying. There is an abundance of \u201cfake news\u201d in health with poor quality health information online. Increasingly digital skills support is focusing on helping people approach the internet critically so that they can appraise information, and mindfully so they are not overwhelmed by it. Read more about this in Victoria Betton and James Woollard\u2019s Teen mental health in an online world.

Previous Chapter What it means in health and social care Current Chapter Current chapter \u2013 How we can support digital inclusion View all Next Chapter Designing for inclusion Page contents Summary Practical steps for supporting digital inclusion locally include finding out rates of digital exclusion, and working on a plan involving everyone from patients to staff. Discover levels of digital exclusion There are several useful tools you can use to check levels of digital exclusion locally. The digital exclusion heatmap shows overall likelihood of digital exclusion by local authority. It does this by combining indicators including infrastructure (broadband and 4G), access (percentage of adults online), basic digital skills, and social indicators (age, education, income and health). The heatmap was last updated in 2017. The Consumer Data Research Centre has produced a detailed mapping of neighbourhoods by internet user classification . Practical steps to help with digital inclusion locally Once you\u2019ve mapped levels of digital exclusion locally, there are several approaches you might consider to tackle the problem, such as: Widening Digital Participation digital skills training digital champions intergenerational mentoring assistive technology free public wi-fi social prescribing digital skills of staff raising awareness Widening Digital Participation The Widening Digital Participation (WDP) programme has been running since 2013, originally managed by NHS England and now by NHS Digital. WDP is being delivered through the Good Things Foundation . In phase one (2013-16), WDP focused particularly on helping people develop digital skills so they can take a more active role in their own health. Over three years: 387,000 people were involved in the programme 221,000 people received digital skills training You can read more about phase one of Widening Digital Participation . WDP phase two runs from 2017 to 2020. Rather than necessarily adopting a digital skills training approach, phase two is using discovery, service design and co-production methods. This involves working with Pathfinders in local communities to take a fresh look at the barriers to digital inclusion and how they might be overcome. Pathfinders are based in areas with particular digital inclusion challenges, working with groups including homeless people, young carers, people with long term conditions, isolated older people, and people in social housing. Full details of all the Pathfinder sites, with descriptions of how the service design has been implemented, case studies and practical how-to-guides based on the lessons learned are published on the WDP digital health lab . WDP Pathfinder sites are fully allocated to 2020, but there are still plenty of ways in which you could implement digital inclusion support locally, such as the following. Digital skills training There are Online Centres in most communities which provide places where people can go to get online in supported environments. Most also provide training in digital skills. You can read real life case studies of the support provided by Online Centres . Learn My Way is a set of free online courses which help people develop digital skills to make the most of the online world, from digital beginners to courses focusing on specific topics, including improving your health online . The government\u2019s essential digital skills framework has been designed to support providers, organisations and employers across the UK who offer training for adults in essential digital skills. It is also worth taking a look at Scotland\u2019s essential digital skills toolkit . It gives a clear description of the skills we all need to make the most of new digital opportunities. It contains simple checklists for measuring digital skills, and guidance on how to interpret the results. The Digital Skills Partnership brings together public, private and voluntary sector organisations to boost skills for a digital economy. Digital champions Many organisations have trained staff and volunteers as digital champions. Digital champions help others to develop their digital skills and understand the benefits of getting online. Digital Unite\u2019s digital champions network provides learning resources, practical tools and an online community. A new online training platform for digital health champions has now been developed by Digital Unite with support from NHS Digital. Using CPD accredited training resources on the platform, digital health champions can understand and help overcome people\u2019s barriers to managing their health online, use popular digital health tools including the NHS website and NHS app, and help people with key tasks such as booking appointments online. The North West London Collaboration of Clinical Commissioning Groups has established a digital citizen education programme . Volunteers are trained as \u201cdigital ambassadors\u201d who in turn are responsible for training residents who need support using digital health services. This video describes the Digital Citizens Education Programme and the role of digital ambassadors in North West London: Intergenerational mentoring Younger people who have grown up in the digital age can be a great resource to introduce older people to digital devices and all the things they could do online. The North West London Digital Citizens Education Programme is beginning to link up local schools with care homes. The best developed example of intergenerational digital mentoring is the digital heroes programme in Wales. This inspirational video shows how children from a primary school in Tredegar have buddied up with a local care home . Visits from the schoolchildren have enthused older residents about digital technology, and led to measurable reductions in medication and falls in the care home. Assistive technology Older people and people with disabilities may be able to use assistive technologies to help them to stay independent and manage their daily lives. Technologies include telehealth and telecare, remote monitoring systems, wearable devices and smart home devices. This review provides an overview of assistive technologies and the latest research into their use. Voice activated systems or \u201cvirtual assistants\u201d can open up new opportunities for people who might otherwise be digitally excluded. Some people may find it difficult to use a computer keyboard because of reduced eyesight or lack of digital skills and confidence. Voice activated systems or \u201cvirtual assistants\u201d such as Amazon Echo (Alexa) and Google Home can open up new opportunities for people who might otherwise be digitally excluded. Local authorities, including Hampshire and Oxfordshire, are now using virtual assistants successfully in care homes . In Cornwall, a partnership between Age UK and the University of Plymouth is improving digital inclusion through provision of Echo Spots . Online health information, including Start4Life on breastfeeding , is increasingly available for access via Alexa. The government\u2019s new Digital Inclusion Fund has provided support for care homes in rural Essex to install smart technology, and train home owners to become \u201cdigital boomers\u201d to help others improve their digital skills. Free public wi-fi Access to free wi-fi can be crucial for people who might find it difficult to afford data costs on their digital device. Free public wi-fi hotspots are increasingly available dotted around towns and cities (although less in rural areas). This handy guide outlines where you can find free Wi-Fi and how to access it, what to watch out for when you're using it and the free Wi-Fi options you may be able to access via your mobile or broadband provider. Free wi-fi on NHS premises makes it easier for patients to use information and services when they most need them. Nearly all GP practices now provide free wi-fi for their patients, as well as most hospital trusts. The following examples show how free wi-fi is improving the experience of patients and their families. NHS WiFi case studies . Social prescribing Social prescribing is a way for local agencies to refer people to a link worker. Link workers give people time, focusing on \u2018what matters to me\u2019 and taking a holistic approach to people\u2019s health and wellbeing. They connect people to community groups and statutory services for practical and emotional support. Find information on social prescribing and links to further resources. This animation shows how GPs are using social prescribing in primary care . A social prescribing network has been established to share good practice. In some areas social prescribing is being used to link up with organisations providing digital inclusion support. In this video, Sheffield GP Dr Ollie Hart talks about how he refers patients to the Heeley Development Trust for help with getting online. Good Things Foundation has produced a how-to-guide on using social prescribing for digital inclusion in health. Digital skills of staff Health and care staff do not always have knowledge and confidence in using digital health resources themselves. This means that they are unlikely to act as digital champions and recommend digital tools to their patients. This can be one of the biggest barriers to digital inclusion. Health Education England is leading work on digital literacy for health and care staff, as part of the building a digital ready workforce programme. This video explains why digital literacy is important to the health and care workforce . A health and care digital capabilities framework has been produced which can be used to support digital literacy training for staff. Digital inclusion now forms part of module 4 (User-centred design and citizen-driven informatics) of the NHS Digital Academy . Raising awareness Many people are not aware of the support available to help them get online and improve their digital skills. Health and care organisations can get involved in awareness raising campaigns, including the annual Get Online Week which takes place every October. Good Things Foundation has downloadable marketing materials on digital health . How we can commission digital inclusion support A digital training and support framework is available for use by public sector organisations (including clinical commissioning groups and local authorities). The framework includes over 50 companies, social enterprises and voluntary sector organisations that specialise in providing digital skills training and assisted digital support. Using the framework can provide a simpler and quicker route than carrying out a full-scale procurement exercise. How we can evaluate digital inclusion support A range of quantitative and qualitative methods could be appropriate for evaluating digital inclusion. These include activity measures (such as numbers engaged or trained), surveys, user interviews, stakeholder interviews, observation, and case studies. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has produced a practical toolkit evaluating digital inclusion initiatives to demonstrate social impact. The Digital Inclusion Evaluation Toolkit contains a range of resources which you could use to measure the impact of digital inclusion initiatives. The patient activation measure is being used in the NHS to measure the knowledge, skills and confidence a person has in managing their own health \u2013 and the improvement in activation following an intervention. It may be appropriate to use as a tool for measuring the impact of a digital inclusion intervention such as digital skills training. Look at the digital health lab to see how different evaluation methods have been used in Widening Digital Participation pathfinders. Summary: supporting digital inclusion step by step You can reflect the approach of the NHS commissioning cycle by following these steps to implementing digital inclusion support locally: Assess need \u2013 map the digital inclusion status of local population Review digital maturity \u2013 enablers including public wi-fi and staff capability Review local existing resources/plans Review any existing digital inclusion support \u2013 including local Online Centre, voluntary organisations and libraries. Work with local stakeholders to identify needs and co-design the best approaches to digital inclusion support Identify potential delivery partners Develop appropriate evaluation mechanisms Establish targets and performance indicators Commission appropriate digital inclusion support Evaluate, refine and scale Last edited: 3 January 2023 7:54 am Previous Chapter What it means in health and social care Next Chapter Designing for inclusion Chapters Digital inclusion for health and social care What we mean by digital inclusion Why digital inclusion matters to health and social care How we can support digital inclusion Designing for inclusion Who we can work with How digital inclusion transforms lives: case studies Links and resources",

This is important, but a lack of digital skills is not necessarily the only, or the biggest, barrier people face. Connectivity Access to the internet through broadband, wi-fi and mobile. People need the right infrastructure but that is only the start. Accessibility Services need to be designed to meet all users\u2019 needs, including those dependent on assistive technology to access digital services. Barriers to digital inclusion Research for the UK digital strategy suggests that there are a number of important barriers, and more than one may affect individuals at any one time. They are: access - not everyone has the ability to connect to the internet and go online skills - not everyone has the ability to use the internet and online services confidence - some people fear online crime, lack trust or don\u2019t know where to start online motivation - not everyone sees why using the internet could be relevant and helpful As access, skills and confidence improve, it is increasingly important to tackle other barriers, including: design - not all digital services and products are accessible and easy to use awareness - not everyone is aware of digital services and products available to them staff capability and capacity - not all health and care staff have the skills and knowledge to recommend digital services and products to patients and service users Good Things Foundation has produced an informative report on motivations of non-users of the internet . People likely to be digitally excluded 90% of households have internet access 78% of people go online using a mobile device There has been real progress in internet and online services. Use Ofcom and Office of National Statistics data to see the latest figures on internet access. But there are still significant levels of digital exclusion, for example: 11,300,000 people lack the basic digital skills to use the internet effectively 4,800,000 people never go online at all The Government Digital Service has developed a digital inclusion scale which maps individuals\u2019 digital capability on a scale from 1 to 9, from those who don\u2019t use the internet at all to digital experts. Some sections of the population are more likely to be digitally excluded than others. These are: older people people in lower income groups people without a job people in social housing people with disabilities people with fewer educational qualifications excluded left school before 16 people living in rural areas homeless people people whose first language is not English For more information on digitally excluded populations in the UK see the annual UK Consumer Digital Index from Lloyds Bank . The 2019 Consumer Digital Index shows: 11.9m people (22% of the population) do not have the digital skills needed for everyday life in the UK by 2030 it is predicted that 4.5m people (8% of the population) will remain digitally disengaged people with a disability are 35% less likely to have essential digital skills for life Good Things Foundation publishes an annually updated Digital Nation infographic showing who's digitally excluded in the UK and the reasons why they are not online. Assisted digital Digital inclusion initiatives can help users improve their digital skills so that they can use online services. However some people will still need assisted digital support such as: access through alternative channels (telephone, face to face) help from others to use online services Health literacy As health information and services are increasingly delivered digitally, the ability to use digital technologies is increasingly a form of health literacy. There is good evidence from the World Health Organization that people with lower health literacy have worse health outcomes. Read more about health literacy in the NHS digital service manual and in the Health Education England health literacy toolkit . Users of digital health services 54% of people looked up health information online in a three month period 40,000,000 people visit the NHS.UK website every month 9% of adults have a smart watch or fitness tracker 98,984 people made a repeat prescription request through the NHS App in one month March 2020 Programmes to empower patients We have a number of programmes designed to help empower patients, and improve digital inclusion NHS.UK website The NHS.UK website attracts nearly 1 million users every day, to access trusted health advice and service information Visit NHS.UK NHS app The NHS App provides a simple and secure way for people to access a range of NHS services on their smartphone or tablet \u2013 from ordering repeat prescriptions to booking and cancelling GP appointments.

Previous Chapter Designing for inclusion Current Chapter Current chapter \u2013 Who we can work with View all Next Chapter How digital inclusion transforms lives: case studies Page contents Summary An overview of organisations and functions involved in supporting the digital inclusion agenda including local authorities, voluntary organisations and specialist digital partners. Local authorities In some places the local health service has formed a partnership with the local authority to tackle digital exclusion. The local authority may take the lead in delivering digital inclusion in the sustainability and transformation partnership or integrated care system . Check whether your local authority has a digital inclusion strategy. For example Norwich and Stoke-on-Trent have a digital inclusion strategy and action plan. Digital Inclusion Strategy \u2013 Norwich City Council Digital Inclusion Strategy \u2013 City of Stoke-on-Trent Public libraries Your local public library can help local people be digitally included. A core responsibility of every public library is to provide: free to use public access computers staff trained in accessing digital information resources Almost all public libraries now have free wi-fi access. Many public libraries are Online Centres, providing free digital skills training. Good Things Foundation has produced a practical guide to doing digital inclusion: libraries handbook . Libraries Connected (The Society of Chief Librarians) has made a commitment to a universal health offer which should be available in public libraries. The Universal Health Offer aims to help people manage their health and wellbeing by signposting to community resources and books including Reading Well self-help reading lists. There is also a universal digital offer which aims to ensure that all public libraries offer a basic level of digital service to the public, including free wi-fi and access to computers. Libraries are also working to develop staff so that they have the skills to help customers who do not normally access information and services online. See how Leeds libraries are working with local partners towards 100% digital Leeds. Libraries can be a focal point for inclusive access NHS libraries and knowledge services Your local NHS library and knowledge service can support the digital, information and health literacy of the healthcare workforce by signposting to high-quality electronic patient information. NHS knowledge services work in partnership with public libraries and voluntary organisations, ensuring access to inclusive digital resources. Voluntary organisations Voluntary organisations are important partners in digital inclusion support. A number of local voluntary organisations are Online Centres . Age UK has a leading role in the One Digital partnership , working to embed digital champions in local Age UK activities with pilots in Leeds, the Lake District, Lancashire and Hereford and Worcestershire. Age UK has also produced a useful evidence review on digital inclusion and older people . Voluntary organisations have been successful in securing funding from the Digital Inclusion Fund , managed by Citizens Online for Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. New projects are being delivered by Uttlesford Council for Voluntary Service, Down\u2019s Syndrome Association, and Weldmar Hospice care Trust. Online centres Brought together by the Good Things Foundation, the Online Centres Network is made up of over 5,000 local organisations working to tackle digital exclusion by providing people with the skills and confidence they need to use digital technologies. Some operate in libraries, community venues, leisure centres or shopping centres, as well as some in more unusual locations like pubs and cafes. Many centres also run outreach sessions, in places like care homes or tenants\u2019 associations. You can find your local Online Centre and talk to them about support available for local people by using the Online Centre search . Commercial organisations In some parts of the country local organisations have developed partnerships with commercial organisations to support digital inclusion. Barclays Digital Eagles is a digital champions programme which includes both face-to-face support in branch with bank staff, and online training modules. Digital Eagles have worked with the Patient Online programme and local CCGs to use Tea and Teach sessions to teach patients to book GP appointments online. Lloyds Bank has been training its staff as digital champions, and in 2017 entered a strategic partnership with Good Things Foundation to create and fund a network of centres that will support learners to improve their digital and financial literacy skills. Google Digital Garage is a digital skills training programme targeted initially at small and medium sized enterprises rather than individual citizens. However, there are now courses for online beginners in partnership with Good Things Foundation . Freeformers is a digital skills training programme from Facebook enabling 18-30 year olds to develop the confidence and the skills they need for future employment in a digital economy. Vodafone is launching free TechConnect classes during 2019, following its report on harnessing technology to tackle loneliness . Specialist digital inclusion partners There are a number of specialist organisations with a wealth of experience in tackling digital exclusion. Here are the leading organisations which you could approach to discuss working together. Good Things Foundation is a national digital inclusion charity, and NHS Digital\u2019s delivery partner in the Widening Digital Participation programme. Good Things co-ordinates the Online Centres Network, provides the online learning platform Learn My Way, carries out research into which digital solutions really make a difference to people\u2019s lives, and delivers major digital inclusion projects. One Digital partnership (funded by the Big Lottery) includes Age UK, Citizens Online, Clarion Futures (part of Clarion Housing Group), Digital Unite and SCVO. They are developing a collaborative approach to training and supporting digital champions so they can help people to learn digital skills. The One Digital Knowledge Hub shares different approaches to training and supporting Digital Champions. Citizens Online is a national charity set up to tackle the issues of digital exclusion. Their Switch approach is designed to help organisations ensure the switch to digital doesn\u2019t exclude people - increasing online service uptake, supporting people to get the benefits of being online, and building skills and sustainable partnerships in local communities. Citizens Online manages the government\u2019s Digital Inclusion Fund. Digital Unite focuses exclusively on vocational training and support for digital champions. Their Digital Champions Network is a comprehensive training and support system for aspiring and experienced digital champions. It has over 140 member organisations and supports thousands of digital champions nationwide with helping others with digital skills. Nominet Trust is the UK\u2019s largest funder of social tech initiatives, with over \u00a317m made in grants since 2009. Currently funded projects include Digital Reach which is funding local projects supporting digital skills for hardest to reach young people. Nominet and the Learning Foundation are now leading Digital Access for All which focuses on ensuring children and young people are not digitally excluded. AbilityNet is working to build a more digitally accessible world, through accessibility audits, user testing, and expert advice to deliver more accessible websites and apps. Their network of AbilityNet IT can help volunteers visit disabled and elderly people in their own homes to fix IT problems. Factsheets and other resources are published. mHabitat is an NHS hosted team specialising in co-design, digital skills and inclusion, policy and strategy, and evaluation. mHabitat has been leading work on digital practitioners helping health and care practitioners develop digital skills and confidence so they can make things better for people who access their services.

      "content": "Digital, research, informatics and virtual environments (DRIVE) partnership A new technology innovation centre has opened at Great Ormond Street Hospital, with backing from us and several technology companies, to transform the use of technology including artificial intelligence in healthcare and improve patient outcomes. The state-of-the-art unit, called DRIVE \u2013 Digital, Research, Informatics and Virtual Environments is the first of its kind in the world. It is both a physical and conceptual unit and is the result of a unique partnership between us, Great Ormond Street Hospital, University College London and leading industry experts in technology, artificial intelligence and digital innovation. The DRIVE unit will be a \u2018hot-house\u2019 for exploration activity, a rich environment for our technologists to work alongside industry and academic colleagues, and the launchpad for concepts which can be \u2018scaled-up\u2019 within our delivery programs or within regional and local technology programmes across the system. The program\u2019s interests in more rigorously exploring the third party market of commodity products and services for use in health and care is very much aligned with those of our organisation. We see the potential for deployment of cross-sector commodity technology across many different areas of our work. Our first three areas of focus will be: The use of commodity integrated-communication technologies to drive collaboration across the system, including video and secure messaging channels as well as traditional email, and integration of these functions with NLP technologies to enable voice-to-text automation, and automated coding of terminology from voice streams. Exploring how best to gain from the explosion in ML, NLP and other AI technologies to enable better leverage of the hugely-rich data within the health and care system to derive new insights about effective and efficient approaches to clinical service provision and to management of the NHS system. Exploring the use of commodity cloud data management and hosting services from hyper-cloud providers to deliver national platforms to facilitate alignment to NHS data standards, particularly FHIR messaging and SNOMED CT to ICD-11 mapping. Read the Memorandum of Understanding signed by Great Ormond Street Hospital and NHS Digital detailing the nature of our partnership. Last edited: 7 September 2021 10:34 am",

Page contents Overview NHS Digital has developed a Breast and Cosmetic Implant Registry (BCIR). This is expected to capture the details of all breast implant procedures completed in England by both the NHS and private providers. The Department of Health directed NHS Digital to carry out this work in response to Recommendation 21 of the Keogh Review of the Regulation of Cosmetic Interventions . The primary purpose of the BCIR is to record the details of any patient, who has had breast implant surgery, so that they can be traced in the event of a product recall or other safety concern relating to a specific type of implant. Should an implant recall arise, an agreed process will be followed. The secondary purpose of the BCIR is to provide an 'early warning system'. A later phase of the registry is to introduce a facility to enter anonymised data, especially if consent rates prove to be low. This would then help provide a denominator for the total number of implant procedures, so if there was to be a recall in the future, the registry would indicate the full scale of the recall. More data on the registry would better inform an outlier process through the identification of any trends and complications related to specific implants. NHS Digital may publish reports on the total numbers and types of implants, procedures and outcomes. These reports will only contain aggregated information (that is, data that has been grouped or combined) so that no individual patient will be identifiable.

Page contents Overview The CVDPREVENT Audit is a national primary care audit that supports the implementation of the NHS Long Term Plan , the annually negotiated GP Contract and the national CVD Prevention programme. The CVDPREVENT Audit is commissioned and delivered by several partners (hereafter referred to as \u2018Audit Partners\u2019) including NHS England, the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (OHID), the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP) and HQIP\u2019s commissioned provider \u2013 NHS Benchmarking Network. The NHS Long Term Plan identifies CVD as a clinical priority and the single biggest condition where lives can be saved by the NHS over the next 10 years. CVD causes a quarter of all deaths in the UK and is the largest cause of premature mortality in deprived areas. The aim of the CVDPREVENT Audit is to support professionally led quality improvement, optimising diagnosis and treatment of high-risk conditions to prevent heart attacks and strokes at scale. The CVDPREVENT Audit also aims to evaluate the national CVD Prevention programme and inform better decisions on its delivery. The data has and continues to help clinicians understand how well they are performing in the diagnosis and management of six high-risk conditions for CVD. CVDPREVENT Audit data has been linked with Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and Mortality data by NHS England. The purpose of this linkage is to facilitate the tracking, monitoring and evaluation of national programme delivery across the life course and care pathway. The linked data will also allow the Audit Partners to determine the impact on outcomes and health inequalities in both primary and secondary care. Furthermore, CVDPREVENT Audit data is being re-used for the purposes of the National Obesity Audit (NOA) . The NOA is required to support the measurement of weight management service provision, interventions and outcomes to facilitate the delivery of efficient, effective and equitable prevention and care. CVDPREVENT Audit data has also been de-identified and held within NHS England\u2019s secure de-identified data environment, Unified Data Access Layer (UDAL), to facilitate the tracking of the recovery of cardiovascular services post COVID-19. It will additionally provide an on-going resource to inform activities supporting NHS England\u2019s statutory functions under the NHS Act 2006.

Page contents Overview NHS Digital has been directed by NHS England to establish and operate an information system for the collection and analysis of local commissioning data, clinical registry data and historic Primary Care Trust data to deliver data services for commissioners. Commissioners of healthcare services need to plan and commission healthcare services in their local area through analysis of actual and projected use of those services. This requires the use of patient-level information and in order to satisfy legal requirements, an intermediary service must be used to process, analyse and package this patient-level information into a format which commissioners can legally use. This intermediary service is provided by the Data Services for Commissioners programme through the Data Services for Commissioners Regional Offices (DSCROs). This notice sets out information for the ongoing submission of relevant data which healthcare providers must comply with. Find out more about this programme. Scope This notice applies to any healthcare provider which has contracted with a commissioner and has an obligation, set out in Schedule 6 of the NHS Standard Contract , to report in accordance with local collections reported locally.

      "content": "Dementia Data Provision Notice Data Provision Notice for the collection of aggregated numbers of patients in England with a record of dementia diagnosis on their clinical record for General Practices in England. Page contents Overview This data collection will be used by NHS England to monitor diagnosis rates for dementia during the period that the data are collected. Collecting dementia diagnosis data broken down by age and gender, as well as ethnicity group, will allow NHS England to monitor dementia diagnoses rates. NHS England requires NHS Digital to collect dementia data to support the Prime Minister's challenge on dementia 2020 and the 2019- 2020 General Medical Services (GMS) contract . The Prime Minister's challenge on dementia 2020 builds on the initial Prime Minister's challenge on dementia . A key part of this initial challenge was to improve dementia diagnosis rates so more patients suffering from dementia would be given a formal diagnosis and therefore receive the appropriate care and support. The challenge highlighted the importance of improving the dementia diagnosis rates in black, asian and minority ethnic groups as evidence suggests that dementia diagnosis in these groups is particularly poor. Dementia data is an established data collection that has been running since 2015. These data are being collected on behalf of NHS England (NHSE) and the Department of Health and Social Care to help ensure that there is an accurate national count of the numbers of patients diagnosed so that national and local initiatives can respond appropriately and monitor increases. Scope of the collection All general practices in England. Legal basis for the collection Section 259(5),(8), 259(1)(a),260 of the Health and Social Care Act. Collection Collected every month.

      "content": "After being part of the Better Training Better Care (BTBC) programme for the last 9 months, I thought it was about time I shared a few recent thoughts and experiences online \u2013 so welcome to my first attempt! The introduction of the BTBC programme was a huge step forward in medical education and training and we haven\u2019t looked back. Our world is changing, expectations are changing, and we know we need to deliver services more effectively, which is why I am on a high after my last week \u2013 I can see the effect BTBC is starting to have on patient care. After a rainy few days in Manchester, I saw first-hand the impact our pilot projects are having. I was really impressed by the enthusiasm at Pennine Trust. Their gaming pilot in Oldham A&E has trainees busy doing more work-based placed assessments. It\u2019s still early days there but trainees seem to be seeing more patients as part of the pilot changes as well as having more supervised training. South Manchester has initiated \u2018Better Training, Better Care\u2019 operating lists, ring-fencing surgery times for specialty trainees in years one and two, and last week implemented their first session. I spoke to the surgeon and the trainee who took part, and the trainee was delighted to have been given this opportunity. A meeting with Geoff Glover from the Higher Education Academy resulted in an exciting opportunity to do a joint piece of work showcasing technology that supports education and training \u2013 in particular, driving Temple\u2019s recommendation of \u2018making every moment count\u2019. Back in Manchester, and again, raining, the BTBC Northern Relationship Manager, Emma, and I met with Sally Chisholm, Chief Executive of NHS Technology Centre. It was a great meeting and we received many contacts from the technology world that are bringing out new ideas. We\u2019re now exploring whether any of these ideas can be used to improve education and training. I really enjoy these meetings \u2013 it\u2019s always nice to be able to sit down, share ideas and kick around new thinking about the programme. Still in Machester (yes, I got my money\u2019s worth out of the train ticket), I met with the wider management team of the North West Deanery. It was good to get feedback from those working hard to make Temple and Collins work on the ground. I was also pleased to hear enthusiasm for the development of community-faced places for foundation trainees, although everyone recognised that it will be hard to bring about this change. I know this is getting a little lengthy now, but there is so much going on that I want to share, so I\u2019ll try and be brief! Our BTBC team officially moved across into Health Education England (HEE), and we met with HEE\u2019s new Director of Nursing, Lisa Bayliss-Pratt (@hee_lisaBP). We\u2019re both excited that nurses want to be part of the programme and make some of these changes happen. Lisa will be visiting some of the pilots over the coming months. The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges Training Advisory Group Committee is excited about the programme and have offered their suggestions about how progress might be made. I\u2019ll also be chatting with Medical Directors and Clinical Directors over the coming weeks \u2013 it\u2019ll be interested to hear their thoughts on how we can progress Lastly, I end this blog where it started \u2013 in Manchester (no doubt more rain!). I\u2019ve been asked to speak at quite a few conferences over the coming months and am looking forward to the Faculty of Medical Leadership and Management conference on Wednesday \u2013 some sun please Manchester this time. So it\u2019s been a jam packed few weeks which I hope will continue. It\u2019s so good to see the programme develop and move forward. BTBC now has legs and we\u2019re running!

      "content": "I happened to be in Manchester again last week \u2013 and the sun was shining this time! I was at the Faculty of Medical Leadership and Management conference running two workshops with the team. We had great feedback around the barriers to making Temple a success, and there were ideas generated around engaging trainees and medical leaders in what needed to be done including rota redesign, consultant team job planning and seeking active board engagement \u2013 including having a Non Executive Director that has Medical Education as part of their portfolio of interest. The trainees gave good ideas about what community-facing placement might look like and made an interesting point about gaining experience in community settings without having to come out of acute focussed posts in a hospital. I met Dr Shelly Hennessey, an acute physician at Leighton Hospital in Mid Cheshire on Thursday \u2013 it\u2019s amazing to see what one individual can do with enthusiasm and the support from the team. I saw the technology they\u2019re working with, showing how trainees risk assess their patients and work through task lists prior to each handover. Though the software may not be compatible in all other Trusts the way in which the project is set up and structured, I am sure can be adopted elsewhere. I was late to Airedale (having to follow a bus down a country road for nearly an hour \u2013 well it felt that long), but did get to see the fantastic work Dr Richard Pope and Ian Williams are doing. I was able to sit in a telemedicine hub and see for myself how trainee-led outreach clinics can be networked back into the hospital for a consultant to give supervision, advice and handover. I also experienced how consultants at home can oversee the medical handover out of hours, providing appropriate supervision to trainees and making every moment count. This provides opportunity to assess trainee communication skills, organisation and delivery and assess their level of competence. We already have many ideas about how this might be expanded further under the BTBC programme. Friday saw me speaking at the North West Deanery\u2019s first annual conference at the Bolton Wanderers Stadium. We had some interesting conversations about how many of the more experienced doctors believe Y-generation doctors in training need to be reminded of the importance of customer care and communication. It seems an issue that needs to be looked at, as I understand it\u2019s not a popular part of the curricula and assessment, although I am interested to hear other\u2019s thoughts about this \u2013 from all generations! Please email your thoughts to btbc@dh.gsi.gov.uk or tweet us at @BTBC_HEEnhs. I ended the week at the British Medical Journal\u2019s Careers Fair on Friday afternoon. It was great to speak to so many trainees there with aspirations to go into a variety of specialties. I also had some important conversations regarding the general move of some hospital services into community based settings and how this may affect career choice. This week I\u2019m back in the office (no more Manchester for a while as much as it\u2019s always great to go there!) and look forward to catching up with the BTBC team to find out how each of the workstreams are progressing.

It also includes high level guidance for workforce planners. This document is informed by discussions by our Board and with the Chairs and Managing Directors of 13 Local Education and Training Boards (LETB). We are publishing it to obtain your views, and those of our stakeholders, to help shape our vision and support its implementation. The aim of the publication is two-fold. Firstly, it clearly sets out the purpose of HEE and our LETBs: that we exist to support the delivery of excellent healthcare and health improvement to the patients and public of England. We do this by ensuring that we have the right numbers of staff, with the right skills and right behaviours, when and wherever they are needed. Because of the time it takes to select, educate, train, recruit and develop the healthcare workforce, the decisions we make today will need to be informed by our imperfect understanding of the future. This purpose, and our focus on the current and future workforce, will be at the heart of all that we do, and we will use it as a guide to action over the coming months and years. Secondly, we realise that we cannot achieve our purpose alone. We will need to work with many stakeholders to understand their current challenges and future opportunities, so that HEE, through our LETBs, can make local and national visions happen through our education commissions and ongoing training and development programmes. From today, we are asking our stakeholders to join a conversation with us to help further define our strategic priorities. The Strategic Intent was formally presented at the Board meeting on 5th February 2013 . We would genuinely welcome your views on our proposed priorities and our Strategic Intent document, by emailing HEE.StrategicIntentFeedback@nhs.net by 31st March 2013. In the meantime, we would like to encourage you to help us share Building HEE: Our Strategic Intent, through your networks, at conferences and speaking engagements or via social media. We look forward to listening to and working with you over the coming months on our core purpose of delivering a better health and healthcare workforce for England. Tweet No related posts.",

      "title": "Statement on Francis Inquiry | Health Education England",
      "content": "The report released today by Robert Francis QC is shaming for the NHS. The failure in the systems that were supposed to oversee and regulate our hospitals are laid bare for all to see and it is important that the NHS takes these issues seriously and works together to make sure we make the changes needed. However, perhaps even more worrying is the focus on the basic lack of care and compassion by individual nurses and doctors and other staff who worked in a poisonous climate in Mid Staffordshire, a culture that has no place in any caring environment and definitely not in our NHS. Without this culture, which Robert Francis describes as \u201cinsidious and negative\u201d there would have been no need for two Francis inquiries and there would have not been the deaths and harm to patients at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust that led us to where we are today. That is why Health Education England (HEE) will be at the forefront of dealing with the problems of values, culture and behaviours that are at the root of the issues addressed by Robert Francis today. Professor Ian Cumming, Chief Executive of HEE, said: \u201cThe values of the NHS, of public service, of compassion and of care are at the root of why the people of this country love the NHS and also why most people who work in the NHS join it in the first place. It is clear that at Mid Staffordshire something went badly wrong with the culture over many years and the values that should be core to everyone who looks after patients were missing or eroded over time. \u201cEven though the scale of what happened at Mid Staffordshire makes it stand out, there are still pockets of poor culture, poor behaviour, lack of care and lack of compassion around the rest of the NHS. \u201cThis has to change and change now. If we get the culture right and ensure that the NHS values run through all that our staff do, we will do more to protect patients than all the regulators and systems in the world. \u201c HEE needs time to read the report in full and consider all of its 290 recommendations, but I also want to be clear about our responsibilities as the new people development service for health and healthcare in England. In response to the Francis report, HEE will lead a cross-NHS set of programmes to ensure we recruit for values at all levels of the NHS from the consultant and chief executive to nurse, porter and receptionist. We will develop a process for NHS employers to use to test values and behaviours of potential employees. If people can\u2019t demonstrate the right values and behaviours they should not get jobs in our NHS. It is as simple as that. \u201cMy personal belief is that we should recruit for values, train around values and appraise individuals based on expression of values. There should be no place in the NHS for people who don\u2019t subscribe to the core values as set out in the NHS Constitution. \u201cHEE will be talking to Universities to ensure that every student we directly or indirectly fund to study nursing, medicine, physiotherapy or any other health related course should be interviewed prior to being offered a place and they should also be subject to an assessment of their values and behaviours. If potential students cannot demonstrate the right values and behaviours to work in healthcare, why should tax payers spend tens or hundreds of thousands of pounds paying for the course for that individual? \u201c We will also be looking at the content of training programmes for all staff \u2013 particularly focussing on the large number of support staff \u2013 ensuring that in addition to values and behaviours people also have the appropriate levels of skills and training to undertake their roles \u201d .

The pledge follows publication of a report on antimicrobial resistance and infectious diseases from England \u2019s Chief Medical Officer ( CMO ), Professor Dame Sally Davies. The second volume of the CMO \u2019s annual report calls for the development of new antibiotics to treat diseases that evolve and become resistant to existing drugs, as well as looking after the antibiotics we already have, which means better hygiene measures to prevent infections, prescribing fewer antibiotics and making sure they are only prescribed when needed. The report also states that more action is needed to tackle the next generation of healthcare associated infections, including new strains that will be harder to treat. The report states that the greatest potential for reducing the impact of infectious diseases includes the education and continuing professional development of health, public health and care professionals as a key component. There is good evidence of the effectiveness of improving staff knowledge and understanding of infection control in improving health outcomes. The CMO \u2019s report has been welcomed by HEE\u2019s Director of Education and Quality Professor Chris Welsh. Professor Welsh said: \u2018HEE strongly support this report. Infection control, particularly control of healthcare associated infections, is essential to the delivery of quality care for patients and the public. He said: \u2018We fully support the responsible use of antibiotics; NHS staff must have the skills, knowledge and training to prescribe and administer antibiotics appropriately.\u2019 \u2018HEE is working for patients and we put patients first in everything we do to improve health and wellbeing.

      "content": "Health Education England (HEE) has recommended the establishment of 13 Local Education and Training Boards (LETBs), which will take on their functions from 1 April if approved. LETB boards, which will be committees of HEE, are made up of representatives from local providers of NHS services. Final decisions about the authorisation of LETBs will be taken at the HEE board meeting on 27 March. Each of the proposed 13 LETBs has a number of areas for development. Areas for development, or conditions, are not indicators of the ability of LETBs, which each have their own unique circumstances. Up until now, LETBs have been operating in shadow form with delegated authority from Strategic Health Authorities. Since November last year, they have been going through a rigorous authorisation process to test their abilities in six specific areas: vision and leadership; meaningful engagement with key partners; good governance; effective financial control; organisational capacity; and outcome-led improvements. At their meeting on 27 March, the HEE board will need to decide whether the LETBs have reached the standards required in each of these areas and are ready to lead local health care education and training. Board members will decide whether each LETB should be authorised, authorised with conditions, or not authorised. Recommendations and any relevant conditions will be available here http://hee.nhs.uk/category/heeboardpapers/ Dr Nicki Latham, HEE Chief Operating Officer, said: \u2018With employers and professionals as part of their governing bodies, LETBs will improve the quality of education and training outcomes to meet the needs of patients, the public and service providers in their areas. Dr Latham said: \u2018They will have the flexibility to invest in education and training to support innovation and development of the wider health system. They will also be able to ensure that money in the new system follows students and trainees on the basis of quality and education and training outcomes. LETBs will be key in ensuring that the system responds to the recommendations of the Francis report and help improve the quality of patient care at every turn.\u2019 From 1 April, HEE will have a dedicated education and training budget of around \u00a35 billion and the majority of this will be spent locally by LETBs. Dr Latham said: \u2018HEE exists for one reason and one reason only: to support the delivery of excellent healthcare and health improvement to the patients and the public of England, by ensuring that or workforce has the right numbers, skills, values and behaviours, at the right time and in the right place.

      "content": "26 March 2013 - 13:53 Today Health Education England is welcoming the announcement by Secretary of State for Health Jeremy Hunt MP that HEE should pilot a scheme whereby those who wish to study NHS funded nursing degrees should first spend time working as a healthcare assistant to assess their values and behaviours and to help them ensure they are making the right career choice. In his response to the second Francis Inquiry into the failings at the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, the Secretary of State said: \u2018Starting with pilots, every student who seeks NHS funding for nursing degrees should first serve up to a year as a healthcare assistant, to promote frontline caring experience and values, as well as academic strength. They will also provide students with helpful experience for managing healthcare assistants when they qualify and enter practice\u2026HEE will explore whether there is merit in extending this principle to other NHS trainees.\u2019 Professor Ian Cumming OBE, Chief Executive of HEE, said: Health Education England exists to improve the quality of care delivered to patients by focusing on the education, training and development of current and future healthcare staff. We therefore welcome the Secretary of State highlighting the importance of values and behaviours to ensure we have an NHS we can all continue to be proud of. Failing to abide by NHS values and the culture that developed in Mid Staffs led to the sort of behaviours that have no place in our NHS. Professor Cumming said: \u2018In the future, by asking prospective students across a range of courses HEE funds to undertake up to a year of real work as a Healthcare Assistant we can start to ensure that the NHS recruits not just for skills and academic ability but also for values and behaviours that can be tested in a real healthcare environment before the NHS spends tens of thousands of pounds on their education. He said: \u2018HEE is committed to working with partners to pilot this idea across NHS and Higher Education organisations we work with, to learn what works best and then agree with patients, students, universities and colleagues across the healthcare system how we move forward to spread best practice.\u2019 Partners are already showing their support for being involved in the pilots and working together to make this initiative a success. Katherine Fenton OBE, Director of Nursing, University College London Hospital, said: \u2018I fully support this proposal and believe it will provide invaluable insight for students as they embark on their healthcare career. Engaging with patients at the very start of their career will help students underpin their training with a first hand understanding of patient needs.\u201d Dr Chris Fowler, Managing Director of Health Education North Central and East London, added: \u2018These internships will provide new recruits to healthcare with a fantastic opportunity to obtain first hand knowledge of the NHS. Experiencing healthcare in action allows students to demonstrate the values and behaviours the NHS needs, whilst enhancing the ability of the NHS to recruit the right people to work with and for patients. With our NHS and university partners we are delighted to have the opportunity to develop and further evaluate this exciting proposal.\u2019 Professor Linda Lang, Dean of Health and Wellbeing, University of Wolverhampton, said: \u2018We are interested in supporting the concept of applicants to nursing and AHP courses undertaking a year of work as a healthcare assistant before progressing to their professional studies. This philosophy fits with our commitment to ensure applicants make fully informed decisions about their career direction in health profession. We currently work closely with partners in practice to ensure applicants to nursing and other health professions demonstrate that they understand the range of career opportunities offered by the NHS and that they demonstrate the right values and attitudes, before they are offered a place to study. We welcome an opportunity to explore and evaluate ways of enhancing the recruitment of the right people with the right attitudes for the future delivery of healthcare.\u2019 Cheryl Etches, Chief Nurse, The Royal Wolverhampton Hospitals NHS Trust, added: \u2018Healthcare work is challenging at its best whilst also being extremely rewarding. Many people commence training for a healthcare profession only to find the reality of their clinical placements a shock and sometimes, sadly, decide healthcare isn\u2019t the right choice for them. Potential healthcare workers of the future could benefit from exposure to the real healthcare environment before committing to a healthcare career and its associated training.\u2019 Professor David Sines CBE PhD, Pro Vice Chancellor, Buckinghamshire New University, said: \u2018We would be most interested in participating in an exploratory pilot project to consider how best to provide pre-qualifying healthcare students with pre-entry experience in healthcare settings as proposed within the context of the Francis Report.\u2019 For further information contact Richard Green, Head of Media Relations, 0208 433 6845/07557 204428 Notes for editors: HEE is committed to ensuring that we play our full part in ensuring that the lessons learnt from Mid Staffs ring through the system, so, as well as piloting pre-degree work as a healthcare assistant programme we are also working to introduce a new test for behaviours and values before the NHS recruits into both universities and our hospitals and other initiatives.

LETB boards, which will be committees of HEE, are made up of representatives from local providers of NHS services and cover the whole of England. They are: Health Education East Midlands Health Education East of England Health Education Yorkshire and the Humber Health Education Wessex Health Education Thames Valley Health Education North West London Health Education South London Health Education North Central and East London Health Education Kent, Surrey and Sussex Health Education North East Health Education North West Health Education West Midlands Health Education South West At a HEE Board meeting today, all 13 were authorised after undergoing a rigorous assessment process to assess their abilities in areas including meaningful engagement with key partners and outcome-led improvements and they will now lead local healthcare education and training. Dr Nicki Latham, HEE Chief Operating Officer, said: \u2018Health Education England exists to improve the quality of care delivered to patients by focusing on the education, training and development of current and future healthcare staff. With employers and professionals as part of their governing bodies, LETBs will improve the quality of education and training outcomes to meet the needs of patients, the public and service providers in their areas.\u2019 Dr Latham said: \u2018They will have the flexibility to invest in education and training to support innovation and development of the wider health system. They will also be able to ensure that money in the new system follows students and trainees on the basis of quality and education and training outcomes. LETBs will be key in ensuring that the system responds to the recommendations of the Francis report and helping to improve the quality of care at every turn.\u2019 She said: \u2018A tremendous amount of work has gone into this process and the LETBs are to be commended in what they have achieved in a short period of time.\u2019 For further information contact Richard Green, Head of Media Relations, 0208 433 6845/07557 204428 Notes for editors: HEE was established on 28 June 2012, working as a shadow Special Health Authority from 1 October 2012.

      "content": "8 April 2013 - 16:06 Shadowing for F1 doctors is set to continue in 2013 following the success of the project in 2012. The first few weeks of employment for medical graduates are not only stressful but are also associated with increased risk for patients and employing organisations. In 2012, HEE introduced a period of paid shadowing immediately before medical graduates took up their F1 post. Evidence suggested that shadowing can reduce the number of serious adverse events. The project\u2019s aim is to ensure that all appointees to F1 spend a minimum of four working days shadowing the F1 job that they will be taking up and completing a trust-based induction. This will help them to become familiar with their new working environment and include a handover of their clinical responsibilities. Chris Welsh, Director of Education and Quality, has written to all medical students and NHS chief executives to advise them of the new arrangements. Chris said: \u201cThis shadowing period will equip our new colleagues with the local knowledge and skills needed to provide safe, high quality patient care, from their first day as a F1 doctor. It builds on a range of developments in undergraduate medical education including student assistantships.\u201d \u201cWhile I acknowledge that foundation trusts cannot be required to implement shadowing, almost all supported this in 2012. I hope that they recognise the benefits to patients and newly appointed F1 doctors of shadowing.\u201d The latest start date for shadowing this year should be Thursday 1 August 2013.

      "content": "22 April 2013 - 11:57 We are disappointed that the RCN chose to use the word \u2018stupid\u2019 about one of the Francis Report recommendations to support better care in the NHS. Francis recommendation 187 said: \u2018There should be a national entry-level requirement that student nurses spend a minimum period of time, at least three months, working on the direct care of patients under the supervision of a registered nurse. Such experience should include direct care of patients, ideally including the elderly, and involve hands-on physical care. Satisfactory completion of this direct care experience should be a pre-condition to continuation in nurse training.\u2019 HEE welcomes this recommendation. By asking prospective students to undertake up to a year of real work as healthcare assistants we can start to ensure that the NHS recruits not just for skills and academic ability but also for values and behaviours that can be tested in a real healthcare environment before the NHS spends tens of thousands of pounds on their education. Up to a quarter of nursing students drop out during their degree, often after their first taste of real hands-on care. We want to work with a variety of groups and individuals from nursing and higher education to test the most effective timescale for the pilots, from at least three months as in the Francis Report and up to a year as in the Government response to that report, potentially with participants having placements working as healthcare assistants in a hospital, in a community setting and in a third setting of their choice. HEE are in contact with the RCN about them being part of the steering group that will oversee the pilots, helping to ensure that we monitor, evaluate and learn lessons.

      "content": "9 May 2013 - 12:21 England\u2019s top nurses will oversee a pilot scheme for student nurses to spend time working as a healthcare assistant before taking up their degree. They are part of a national steering group announced today by Health Education England. The group will be chaired by Sir Stephen Moss, a non-executive director at Derby Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and former turnaround chair at the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust. The group includes nursing leaders from the Royal College of Nursing, the Nursing and Midwifery Council, the Care Quality Commission, NHS England, the Department of Health, Public Health England, NHS Employers and the NHS Trust Development Authority. Robert Francis, in his inquiry report into the failings at Mid Staffs, recommended that student nurses should spend at least three months working on the direct care of patients before their degree course. He called for an increased focus in nurse training and education on the practical requirements of delivering compassionate care and evidence of the appropriate values, attitudes and behaviours. The Government response to the Francis report proposed that student nurses should spend up to a year working on the front line in order to receive NHS funding for their degree.The steering group announced today will oversee a pilot programme, working with partners across the NHS and higher education, to see how best to take forward these proposals and assess the most appropriate timescale. Pilots are likely to involve up to 200 nursing students on paid placements across the country from this autumn and the steering group will also be responsible for evaluation in areas including the ability to test for values and behaviours and reductions in attrition rates. Professor Ian Cumming OBE, Chief Executive of Health Education England, said: \u2018By asking prospective students to undertake up to a year of experience on the front line, we can start to ensure that the NHS recruits not just for skills and academic ability but also for values and behaviours that can be tested in a healthcare environment before the NHS spends thousands of pounds on their education. Professor Cumming said: \u2018The healthcare experience will allow students to understand whether nursing and hands-on care is right for them. It will mean better, more experienced and more committed students in our universities. That is good for patients and good for the NHS. He said: \u2018It should also help to reduce the drop-out rates at university. It should be hard to be a nurse \u2013 a vocation, a real desire, not just something you accept as second best so you can do a degree course.\u2019 Sir Stephen Moss, Chair of the steering group, said: \u2018I am delighted to have been asked to chair the steering group for this important piece of work and look forward very much to working with a very experienced and committed group of colleagues on the implementation and evaluation of the pilots. Sir Stephen said: \u2018I am proud to be a nurse and want to do everything I can to ensure that we take this opportunity to address the many challenges currently facing our profession. He said: \u2018It is vitally important that we deliver skilled patient care, with kindness and compassion, and piloting this pre-degree experience will enable us to test out the effectiveness of exposing potential students to front line care and professional values at an early stage, before their formal degree programme. Of one thing I am certain, that is that things cannot stay as they are. We owe it to those we serve to continually seek new and innovative ways to meet their needs.\u2019 Ends For further information contact Richard Green, Head of Media Relations, 07557 204428 Notes for editors: HEE was established on 28 June 2012, working as a shadow Special Health Authority from 1 October 2012.

      "content": "14 May 2013 - 11:00 For health, care and support to be \u2018integrated\u2019, it must be person-centred, coordinated, and tailored to the needs and preferences of the individual, their carer and family. It means moving away from episodic care to a more holistic approach to health, care and support needs, that puts the needs and experience of people at the centre of how services are organised and delivered. Where local areas have succeeded in integrating health, care and support services, too often it has been despite the national system rather than because of it. This is why Health Education England has joined a range of national partner organisations, to support local areas to tackle these national barriers and allow locally-led, integrated services to flourish. Context setting for the Framework document As national partners, we have co-produced Integrated Care and Support: our shared commitment \u2013 a framework document on integration. The document, signed by all the partners, sets out how local areas can use existing structures such as Health and Wellbeing Boards to bring together local authorities, the NHS, care and support providers, education, housing services, public health and others to make further steps towards integration. Context setting for the Narrative National Voices, a national coalition of health and care charities, has developed a person-centred \u2018narrative\u2019 on integration. This is an agreed definition of what we mean by \u2018integrated\u2019 care. It provides a guide to the sort of things that integrated care will achieve, such as better planning, more personal involvement of the person using services, and free access to good information. It also provides some clarity over what local areas should be aiming to achieve practically, in their efforts to integrate services. It is written not just for the experts, but for patients, people, families and carers. It shows them what they have a right to expect, so they can then demand the most helpful care and support. As a national partner we have adopted this definition of what good integrated care and support looks and feels like for people, and we are asking local areas to sign up to using it too. Context setting for the Pioneers programme Together the national partners are asking local areas to express an interest in becoming \u2018pioneers\u2019 to act as exemplars, demonstrating the use of ambitious and innovative approaches to efficiently deliver integrated care. We are looking for pioneers that will work across the whole of their local health, public health and care and support systems, and alongside other local authority departments as necessary, to achieve and demonstrate the scale of change that is required. The national partners will provide tailored support to pioneers. In return, we expect them to be at the forefront of sharing and promoting what they\u2019ve learned for wider adoption across the country.

      "content": "15 May 2013 - 10:19 A new online training resource has been launched today to ensure that all staff in the NHS and in social care can be dementia-aware. The e-learning resource will help to deliver the roll out of the Prime Minister\u2019s dementia package that would see 100,000 nurses and health care assistants receiving dementia training by e-learning by 2015. The e-learning sessions in dementia have been developed by e-Learning for Healthcare, part of Health Education England (HEE), the new body responsible for the education and training of health and healthcare staff. Jeremy Hunt, Secretary of State for Health announced further measures to tackle dementia, one year on from the Prime Minister\u2019s Challenge of Dementia. This ambitious programme of work is designed to make a real difference to the lives of people with dementia and their families and carers. The Dementia e-learning sessions have been designed to familiarise health and social care staff with recognising and understanding dementia and to be able to signpost appropriate support. Written by experts in both psychiatry and medicine for the elderly, the e-learning supports both the implementation of the National Dementia Strategy and David Cameron\u2019s challenge. Staff will be able to access three 30 minute sessions of learning which will support staff with difficult questions such as \u2018I am worried about Dad\u2019 that could be asked of anyone in contact with patients and families on a day to day basis. It also covers the importance of public health messages and addressing social stigma as essential in making a difference in caring for people with dementia. In addition, a further ten 30 minute sessions are available which support more advanced practice in assessing and managing dementia, whilst equipping staff with the skills to provide high quality dementia care. Professor Chris Welsh, Director of Education and Quality of HEE said: \u201cThe nature of dementia means that managing the condition can pose unique and sometimes difficult issues for staff, both in the hospital and in the community. \u201cWe believe that care for patients with dementia needs to start in education to create a dementia-aware workforce. This e-learning tool is the first step in a three stage programme led by Health Education England in improving the care for those with dementia. \u201cOver the coming months, we will be working with providers of education to ensure that dementia and other long term conditions play a far greater role in the knowledge and the skills we expect of those who graduate to become professionals in the NHS. \u201cThis will become a mandatory part of the education we expect all staff to have before joining the NHS\u201d. Stage three will be the delivery of expert leaders in each NHS institution who will work across disciplines, and with senior staff, to lead dementia awareness, treatment and training programmes. The development of these posts will be supported by Local Education and Training Boards (LETBs) in their work locally with NHS providers of care.

      "content": "28 May 2013 - 00:15 Professor Ian Cumming, Chief Executive of Health Education England, has today welcomed the Government\u2019s Mandate to Health Education England that sets out plans for education and training for all NHS staff. The mandate to HEE, the new organisation set up to provide national leadership on education, training and workforce development, includes a comprehensive and wide-ranging series of measures. It is a blueprint for NHS staff training. It is the first time ever that a single organisation has had responsibility for all NHS staff education, recruitment, training and development. HEE has a budget of \u00a35 billion to help NHS staff improve their ability to care for patients. HEE is central to the reformed health system and is uniquely placed to have the greatest impact on improvements in patient care by focusing on values and behaviours and educating, training and developing the workforce responsible for delivering that care. The plans announced today emphasise the importance of training for support staff providing community care and preventing patients, those with long term conditions for example, needing to go into hospital. The mandate includes a focus on: recruitment into all new NHS-funded training posts including assessment of appropriate values and behaviours; ensuring every student who seeks NHS funding for nursing degrees should first serve up to a year as a healthcare assistant; delivery of additional trained health visitors to increase the workforce by 4,200 full time equivalents by April 2015; providing dementia awareness training for all NHS staff who look after patients, ensuring that 100,000 staff have foundation level training by March 2014; and commissioning the required number of IAPT (increasing access to psychological therapies) training places. Professor Cumming said: \u2018Health Education England exists for one reason and one reason only: to improve the quality of care delivered to patients by focusing on the education, training and development of the current and future workforce. He said: \u2018We are here to develop people for health and healthcare. We are responsible for the education, training and personal development of every member of NHS staff and for recruiting for values from our schools and into our universities. \u2018It costs \u00a370,000 to train a qualified nurse and \u00a3500,000 to train a GP. Investing in our current and future workforce is the only way to future-proof the NHS, ensuring that our staff have the flexibility and skills to provide care in the community as we respond to the demands of older patients with more complex needs.\u2019 The mandate published today is aligned with national NHS priorities to tackle preventable deaths; empower and support people living with long-term conditions; introduce a culture of caring; and for the diagnosis, treatment and care of people with dementia in England to be among the best in Europe. It is set out under six broad themes: support for service priorities; NHS values and behaviours; excellent education; competent and capable staff; working in partnership; and value for money.

      "content": "27 June 2013 - 15:58 Health Education England (HEE) is calling for evidence to help support and shape workforce planning within the NHS. With over 1.3 million staff performing over 300 different types of jobs across more than a 1000 different employers, the NHS requires a robust workforce planning process to ensure we have staff in the right numbers, with the right skills and the right values and behaviours to deliver high quality care. HEE has published comprehensive workforce planning guidance for the NHS \u2013 the first of its kind seen in the NHS. The guidance provides clarity for the system about who needs to do what by when, so that together we can use our different levers and resources to achieve our common goals. It represents a radical departure from what has gone before, and sets out a transparent, evidence based, and risk assessed decision making process setting out the milestones and timelines for the planning process to be operated in 2013/14 to produce 2014/15 workforce investment plans. Our ambition is to secure the future supply of workforce, in a way that both maintains safe staffing levels for patients, whilst supporting the transformation of services necessary to drive quality improvement. In order to help us to fulfil our national role, we need to draw upon the experience and views of key stakeholders. We recognise that many stakeholders have generated important perspectives on the future workforce and we are seeking your support in identifying key issues, perspectives and evidence, which we can use to shape our final plans. All submissions must be evidence based, and address all three components of numbers, skills, values and behaviours, to ensure that our future workforce can deliver high quality care.

      "content": "9 July 2013 - 11:36 We have published a report which summarises the key messages from a stakeholder event held on the 19 June 2013 to help design a new Multi Professional Advisory Body (MPAB). At HEE we know that to achieve the best outcomes for patients, we need to develop key relationships with our stakeholders and work in partnership with the wider system to ensure that: \u2022 The decisions HEE make are driven by the needs of current and future patients and informed by the advice and expertise of our stakeholders, partners and patients. \u2022 HEE receive valuable uni professional advice, along with a multi professional forum to get advice on education, training and workforce planning from across the system To ensure we are able to meet these expectations we conducted a mapping exercise of the existing advisory structures, and sought views from our stakeholders. We found there was a consensus that although the status quo provides a rich source of intelligence and advice, there was a need to revise and simplify the advisory landscape, and design new decision making architecture that would meet our needs. Our new simplified Advisory Arrangements proposed a new Multi Professional Advisory Body (MPAB), as a means by which the board of Health Education England can receive the very best advice from a range of views and perspectives. To help us design our new advisory arrangements, we invited stakeholders to an event on 19 June. The report below summarises the key messages from the event; identifies areas of consensus, key risks and our proposed solutions and outlines next steps for the development of the MPAB.

      "content": "11 July 2013 - 09:00 Director of Nursing, Lisa Bayliss-Pratt, on the BTBC pilots and her vision for the whole healthcare team: Taking on the role of Director of Nursing for HEE, my aspiration was to see positive change on the frontline involving the whole healthcare team. When I heard about our Better Training Better Care (BTBC) programme, I thought it could become reality in the very near future. BTBC is all about improving education and training, and therefore improving patient care. Part of the programme saw 16 NHS Trusts pilot education and training based projects to deliver increased patient safety in a sustainable way. Many of the trusts are seeing successful early findings and that dream I had when I started at HEE is starting to take shape. After 12 months of piloting these projects, I\u2019ve gone out to experience this change first hand. The people who I met during my visits were testaments to our values. Staff were positive and engaged with the new way of delivering training, and wards and learning environments were clean. So the end result? Our pilots are demonstrating how introducing structured education and training programmes into trusts improves patient care. And, that when you structure training, it, by default, involves other professions. Not surprisingly, nurses, doctors and other members of the healthcare team are all reporting back that they feel more a part of the team, they feel like their making better use of their time and skills and feel patients are receiving better experiences because of it. A few weeks ago I visited Airedale NHS Foundation Trust and East London Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust. Airedale are using telemedicine to enhance training and improve supervision and it was great to see the team embrace technology and to hear there are helping other organisations, which are learning from their experiences. East London has developed simulation-based training for mental health scenarios, based on real-life serious incidents. Nurses, doctors and other members of the healthcare team participated in sessions with actors to work through serious incident scenarios. It was one of the most powerful and eye-opening training sessions I\u2019ve seen. The early findings show the pilot is a success and feedback from participants was so positive, that it made me think about the next steps: How do you go from \u2018project\u2019 to \u2018every day practice\u2019? The next question for me is how can we embed the excellent practice locally and spread and adopt this at pace. In my career I have seen many excellent initiatives, however, all too often they fail to become embedded and or evaluated properly to truly demonstrate the difference that they can make to the workforce and those that we serve. We will make sure the BTBC pilots don\u2019t follow this path and will ensure they are properly embedded in trusts across the country. Tweet Categories: BTBC blog \u2022 Home",

      "content": "22 July 2013 - 09:39 A major improvement in patient safety developed by Health Education West Midlands has been recognised with a prestigious national award. SCRIPT is an e-learning platform for junior doctors that helps them to prescribe medicines more safely and effectively. The initiative picked up the award for \u2018Improving Safety in Medicines Management\u2019 at the recent Patient Safety Awards. It is a 40-module programme that tests students as they complete each block of modules to measure their improvement. The idea came from Professor Liz Hughes, Director of Education and Quality at Health Education West Midlands and the West Midlands Postgraduate Dean, following studies indicating that some newly-qualified doctors needed further preparation for prescribing. SCRIPT involved specialists and academics from Health Education West Midlands, Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust, the University of Birmingham, Aston University and the University of Warwick. The project team includes academics and clinical pharmacists and pharmacologists from local hospital trusts. Professor Hughes said: \u201cThe development of SCRIPT represents a significant contribution to patient safety by improving prescribing knowledge for both medical and non-medical prescribers alike. She said: \u201cWe were delighted to win the award. We have had excellent feedback from junior doctors who have used SCRIPT and we are very pleased that other regions are now adopting it themselves. We knew that it was a very important initiative that would help junior doctors to deliver safer, better care to patients but it was good to get national recognition for the work.\u201d For further information contact Sukvinder Kaur, Senior Project Manager, sukvinder.kaur@wm.hee.nhs.uk - END - Notes for editors: HEE was established on 28 June 2012, working as a shadow Special Health Authority from 1 October 2012.

We are committed to ensuring that the NHS has the workforce in the right numbers but also with the right values and behaviours to deliver high quality care. Over the longer term, we see values based recruitment as part of a wider programme to change attitudes and behaviours of NHS staff, enhancing their engagement and delivering continuously improving and safer healthcare for patients. Students and trainees need exposure to the right attitudes, values and behaviours from day one to ensure they get the greatest benefit from a good learning environment. HEE will ensure that recruitment into both future NHS-funded training, and to a job in the NHS, includes testing candidates for values and behaviours. Students should receive the appropriate level of support to ensure that they are able to provide safe and effective prevention and care as part of their supervised training. Where that is not the case, poor quality education and training leads to poor quality care. Students and trainees should feel confident to raise concerns and we will provide support and act swiftly and decisively. Any issues about the quality of education and training need to be addressed openly and transparently, with information shared to ensure we protect the interests of patients. Students and trainees are uniquely placed, they are the eyes and ears of the service, and provide valuable information about the effectiveness of their education and training and, in turn, the quality and safety of patient care.

It gives me great pleasure to welcome our new generation of doctors as you embark on careers that will be fulfilling and rewarding for you and also help to deliver safe, high quality care for the patients we serve. Health Education England (HEE) exists for one purpose only \u2013 to help deliver the highest quality public health and healthcare possible to the population of England. We are the new body responsible for the education and training of the entire workforce, across the 350 careers that are delivering health services. As Director of Education and Quality at HEE, and as a former NHS surgeon, I believe that by investing in people and delivering high quality education and training, we will deliver improved patient care. It\u2019s my job to make sure this happens, and I believe it starts with our students. You, as junior doctors and medical students, and the 160,000 others who are on NHS courses every day, have responsibility for delivering high quality of care to your patients. In HEE, we are responsible for the quality of your education and training now and in the future. We want to know that you\u2019re getting that. As a junior doctor, you will be enthusiastic and eager to make a difference to the lives of your patients. I was too. Some of you joining the service now will still be in the NHS in 2050. I don\u2019t know what healthcare will look like then, neither do you, but we should always be open to the new, ever prepared to learn, innovate and change. Only then can we ensure the best for our patients. If you have ideas that you think could improve patient care, we will support you to be innovative and bold so that you can make a difference. Equally, as the eyes and ears of health services, if you see something that is wrong, don\u2019t stand by and let it happen, but tell someone about it. We are investing just under half of our \u00a35bn budget funding doctor\u2019s university degrees and postgraduate placements. This huge investment is not just about providing you with the skills to care for patients, but instilling the core values from the NHS Constitution in our staff. Compassion, understanding, delivering high quality care and putting patients first are just a few of the attributes we expect you to bring into the NHS during your career. That\u2019s why, this year and next, every member of NHS staff will be recruited, not only on qualifications, knowledge and experience, but also on your values and behaviours. That can only be good for our patients and our NHS. I\u2019m enormously proud to be part of HEE and what it is trying to achieve \u2013 a health service with the right people with the right values, skills and behaviours and in the right numbers \u2013 and proud of my 30-year record of service as a surgeon. I hope that our investment in you, as the next generation of doctors helps you to fulfil your ambitions to deliver excellent care to patients now and in the future. Over the next few months, I am keen to get out and about where I can to meet and hear from you in your universities and NHS placements and I look forward to meeting some of you during the course of your studies.

We know that many employers have been working to embed the right values, attitudes and behaviours in their trusts for some time now, all driven by a desire to improve outcomes for patients\u2026.you\u2019ve also been telling us that to do values based recruitment properly and evaluate its impact is complex. We held two events entitled \u2018Values based recruitment: start as you mean to go on\u2019 in Leeds and London to find out how we can best support you to test and assess the values of potential recruits. Over 140 senior HR professionals from the NHS attended. The events were co-chaired by Dean Royles (Chief Executive) and Sue Covill (Director of Employment Services) from NHS Employers and Nicki Latham (Chief Operating Officer) from Health Education England. With the aim of showcasing some of the good work already happening across the NHS to recruit the right people into the service, delegates heard from four trusts about their values work: Bradford District Care Trust York Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, and Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust Each speaker explained why their trust had set out to embed values in their recruitment and other employment practices, the context they were working in, what they had done to implement values based recruitment, and the impact it had had to date. Discussions were held to establish how employers felt we could support you to embed values in your own employment practice. The ideas gathered will be used to inform proposals for how we continue to work with you on this important agenda.

      "content": "15 August 2013 - 12:40 Up to 200 aspirant nurses will be recruited in care settings in six areas across England to get real, paid caring experience for up to year as a Healthcare Assistant before they apply to take up an NHS-funded degree course. Earlier this year, the government, in its response to the Francis Inquiry into the failings at Mid Staffordshire Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, asked Health Education England (HEE) to work with partners across the NHS and higher education to pilot a scheme whereby aspirant student nurses spend up to a year on the frontline prior to receiving NHS funding for their degree. In his Inquiry, Robert Francis called for an increased focus in nurse training and education on the practical requirements of delivering compassionate care and evidence of the appropriate values, attitudes and behaviours. The pilots will explore the most appropriate timescale for the scheme, and will be evaluated for the ability to test for values and behaviours and reductions in attrition rates. Health Education England has confirmed that pilots will take place in a range of NHS/care settings in six of its thirteen Local Education and Training Boards (LETBs). These are: East of England; East Midlands; North Central and East London; North East; North West; and West Midlands. Participants in the pilot will: be a pioneer in a new learning opportunity for people who want to go to university to train as a nurse; get paid to gain vital experience of caring for patients on the front line of the NHS; find out whether a caring career really is right for them so they can make the right choice; have support in their application for university to train as a nurse; and be part of a drive to widen participation in the NHS and encourage people from a wide variety of backgrounds, no previous care experience necessary to apply. Recruitment for the first cohort begins during August 2013, with the pilots starting in September. The successful individuals will work as healthcare assistants in a range of care settings expected to include hospitals, GP practices and health centres and mental health units. HEE seeks to embed the missions and values of the new NHS Constitution in the recruitment and education and training of staff working in health and healthcare. Dr Lisa Bayliss-Pratt, Director of Nursing at HEE, said: \u2018We were pleased with the level of interest we received from partners wanting to be involved in the pilots. The areas will be looking to recruit people who aspire to be a nurse, but have little or no experience of caring.\u2019 Dr Bayliss-Pratt said: \u2018We have already had a good response to the recruitment adverts in the West Midlands and North West which is an encouraging start.\u2019 She said: \u2018It is important for aspirant nurses to get a feel of what is required of nursing and to provide compassionate care for individuals who may be at their most vulnerable. This is in addition to giving us a chance to test whether they have the right caring attributes and values to work in the NHS.\u2019 Pauline Yarker, Acting Head of Education Commissioning and Quality, Health Education North East, taking part in the pilot, said: \u2018We\u2019re enthusiastic about being part of this pilot to explore and evaluate ways of ensuring the NHS recruits the right people with the right values to work for our patients.\u2019 Pauline said: \u2018Experiencing the front line at the very beginning of their career will allow those considering a nursing career, before committing to a healthcare profession to get a first-hand understanding of patient needs. A national steering group designed the pilots and developed a set of guiding principles at its inaugural event in June to support their work. The steering group is chaired by Sir Stephen Moss, a non-executive director of Derby Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and a former nurse. Visit www.hee.nhs.uk to find out more about the pilot and the opportunity to participate. Recruitment to the pilot has now closed. Categories: Home \u2022 News",

      "title": "Health Education England \u00bb Leadership alliance formed to respond to the independent review of the Liverpool Care Pathway",
      "content": "30 August 2013 - 10:00 All patients, irrespective of whether or not they are on the Liverpool Care Pathway (LCP) or any other integrated care pathway, should receive high quality, compassionate care in the last days and hours of life, and their families should be supported. But this is not always the case and we must address that inconsistency. In the report by the independent review of the LCP the review panel called for a coalition of regulatory and professional bodies to lead the way in creating and delivering the knowledge base, the education, training and skills and the long-term commitment needed to make high quality care for dying patients a reality, not just an ambition. A Leadership Alliance for the Care of Dying People (LACDP)is being set up under the chairmanship of Dr Bee Wee, National Clinical Director for End of Life Care at NHS England, to do this. NHS England, the Care Quality Commission (CQC), Department of Health (DH), General Medical Council (GMC), Health Education England (HEE), NHS Improving Quality (NHS IQ), Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) have already signed up to join the alliance to: support everyone involved in the care of people who are dying to respond to the findings of the review; be the focal point for the system\u2019s response to the findings and recommendations of the LCP review; provide guidance on what needs to occur in place of the LCP; consider how best health and social sector can address the recommendations in the review about the accountability and responsibility of individual clinicians, out of hours decisions, nutrition and hydration and communication with the patient and their relatives or carers: and map existing guidance, training and development, as a prelude to considering how these impact on the care of dying people and the circumstantial factors that might affect the adoption of good practice. The LACDP will engage extensively with both professionals involved in caring for dying people as well as individuals themselves and their families and other carers to gather views and ideas on good practice in caring for someone in the last days and hours of life.

      "content": "2 September 2013 - 14:00 The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) and Health Education England (HEE) are consulting on the supply of pharmacy graduates in England. This follows a request from the Government for both organisations to review the current arrangements for the study of pharmacy, and the publication of a report by the Centre for Workforce Intelligence on the future pharmacist workforce. The consultation will address concerns that there may be an over-supply of pharmacy graduates, compared with the demand for registered pharmacists and the consequent availability of pre-registration placements in the NHS. The HEFCE/HEE joint consultation proposes three options: To continue to allow the market to determine the number of pharmacy graduates. To introduce an intake control at each university for entrants to MPharm pharmacy programmes. To create a break-point during study which enables some students to graduate with a Bachelor of Science degree and others to progress through further study to qualify as registered pharmacists. The consultation is aimed at a wide range of stakeholders, including universities, employers, regulators, professional bodies and students. It is open until 15 November and the outcomes and next steps will be published in early 2014. This first stage will be followed by a more detailed second-stage consultation in 2014. Any changes are likely to take effect from the 2015-16 academic year. HEFCE and HEE are keen to ensure that the interests of current and prospective students are fully respected at all points in this process. Key facts There are 37,900 pharmacists registered with the General Pharmaceutical Council practising in England. Student intakes in pharmacy have grown from 1,390 in 1998 to 3,100 in 2012. In 2012-13 there were 3,104 home and EU students and 643 (21 per cent) international fee paying students in the first year of MPharm programmes in England. At present 21 English universities are accredited for the MPharm course compared with 12 in 2002. A further two are seeking full accreditation in the next two years. Sir Alan Langlands, HEFCE Chief Executive, said: \u2018This is a pivotal moment for pharmacy education and training, and this consultation offers everyone with an interest in this matter an opportunity to give their views on the future direction of travel. We do not have a firm view but it will be especially important to consider the impact of any decision on the wider population, patients in the NHS and current and prospective students who wish to pursue a professional careers in pharmacy.\u2019 Professor Chris Welsh, Director of Education and Quality at HEE, said: \u2018Having the right number of staff with the right skills and attitudes is of course central to patient care. Through this consultation, we are looking to explore, with employers, universities, students, professional bodies and patient groups, the best options available to deliver safe, effective use of medicines and public health by pharmacists and their teams. Delivering a pharmacist workforce, fit for the future, is how we can ensure, above everything else, that we provide safe and high quality care to patients\u2019.

The letter from David Willetts is Annex A to the consultation. See the CfWI report . Undergraduate programmes in pharmacy consist of four years of study leading to an MPharm or MPharm (Hons). The MPharm is the only qualification in the UK which leads to professional registration as a pharmacist. MPharm programmes are accredited by the General Pharmaceutical Council. Pharmacists qualify by completing this degree, then undertaking a year of pre-registration training with an employer, often the NHS. On successful completion of this training, and after passing the pre-registration exam, they become registered pharmacists. Unlike medicine and dentistry, for which numbers are controlled centrally, there is currently no control on the number of students studying pharmacy. The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) promotes and funds high-quality, cost-effective teaching and research to meet the diverse needs of students, the economy and society. We distribute funds, safeguard quality and assure the stewardship of public money. We work closely with universities, colleges and other partners to develop policies, achieve excellence and impact in education and research, and to provide opportunities for all those who have the ability to benefit from higher education.

      "content": "20 September 2013 - 10:40 Health Education England, along with the College of Paramedics, support the recently published Paramedic Evidence Based Education Project report, issued by the Allied Health Professionals Health Education Advisory Group (formally the Department of Health\u2019s AHP Professional Advisory Board). This report calls for the introduction of a national education and training framework for paramedics. It suggests that local training currently being delivered differs dependant on location, and therefore provides trainees with different experiences and levels of support. The report lists a number of recommendations for HEE to implement in order to improve training for the paramedic workforce so that they can deliver the best possible care to patients. Some of the key recommendations include: A standardised approach to education and training Agree a pre-registration education development model leading to an all graduate profession Knowledge and skills enhancement Development of a partnership model Paramedic leadership for England A standardised approach to identification Professor Chris Welsh, Director of Education and Quality for HEE, said: \u201cWe note the recommendations in this report, however we also understand it is not a full account of issues paramedics are facing in relation to education and training. We\u2019ll be working closely with the College of Paramedics and other stakeholders to look at these recommendations and implement those that have the greatest impact on patient care.\u201d Professor Andy Newton Chair of the College of Paramedics said: \u201cAs sponsors of the report we were delighted to receive this wide-ranging review highlighting many of the issues facing the profession.

This report calls for the introduction of a national education and training framework for paramedics. It suggests that local training currently being delivered differs dependant on location, and therefore provides trainees with different experiences and levels of support. The report lists a number of recommendations for HEE to implement in order to improve training for the paramedic workforce so that they can deliver the best possible care to patients. Some of the key recommendations include: A standardised approach to education and training Agree a pre-registration education development model leading to an all graduate profession Knowledge and skills enhancement Development of a partnership model Paramedic leadership for England A standardised approach to identification Professor Chris Welsh, Director of Education and Quality for HEE, said: \u201cWe note the recommendations in this report, however we also understand it is not a full account of issues paramedics are facing in relation to education and training. We\u2019ll be working closely with the College of Paramedics and other stakeholders to look at these recommendations and implement those that have the greatest impact on patient care.\u201d Professor Andy Newton Chair of the College of Paramedics said: \u201cAs sponsors of the report we were delighted to receive this wide-ranging review highlighting many of the issues facing the profession.

      "content": "4 November 2013 - 09:27 Fourteen pioneering initiatives are transforming the way health and care is being delivered to patients by bringing services closer together than ever before. The pioneers are showcasing innovative ways of creating change in the health service, which the Government and national partners want to see spread across the country, Care and Support Minister Norman Lamb announced today. The fourteen ambitious initiatives are blazing a trail for change by pioneering new ways of delivering coordinated care. The pioneers have been selected by a renowned panel of experts, including international experts drawing together global expertise and experience of how good joined up care works in practice. The aim is to make health and social care services work together to provide better support at home and earlier treatment in the community to prevent people needing emergency care in hospital or care homes. Results from these approaches in the pioneer areas include: 2,000 fewer patient admissions over a two and a half year period, achieved through teams of nurses, social workers, occupational therapists and physiotherapists working together to prevent crises Reducing waiting times from eight weeks to 48 hours at physiotherapy services by making professionals work closer together Setting up a crisis house where people who suffer mental health problems can get intensive support With the number of people with more than one long term condition such as diabetes, asthma or dementia set to rise from 1.9 million in 2008 to 2.9 million in 2018 and increasing pressures on A&E departments, the need to deliver better joined-up care and a more sustainable NHS has never been more urgent. Professor Ian Cumming, Chief Executive, Health Education England said, \u201cAs one of the national partners HEE welcomes the role of the pioneers. We are committed to supporting localities in workforce training and organisational development, working with relevant Local Education and Training Boards (LETBs), to stimulate working cultures that actively encourage integrated care and support. \u201cThe education and training of healthcare staff is vital in the widespread adoption of integrated care across the NHS, public health and social care systems. We will work with the pioneers and health and care partners to build on existing work such as skills passports and national minimum training standards, in order to develop common standards and portable qualifications to make it easier for staff to work and move between settings. Through this focus, can we ensure that the workforce has the right skills, values and behaviours, in the right numbers, at the right time and in the right place to deliver integrated care.\u201d To read the full DH press release click here.

      "content": "19 November 2013 - 14:26 I warmly welcome the Government response and I am pleased that Health Education England will be at the forefront of work to implement many of these recommendations. I am immensely proud of all the work that HEE has already done this year. Today\u2019s recommendations provide us with a platform to take this even further over the coming months and years. Although only established earlier this year, we have shown the immediate effect we can have while we also look a long way ahead to help ensure that the failures we witnessed at Mid Staffordshire are never repeated. Our priority at HEE is quite clear. We exist for one reason only: to help improve the quality of care patients receive. Values, behaviours, care and compassion drive the work that we do. The patient is the priority. As part of this work, we recruited 180 aspirant nurses to the first phase of our pre-nursing care pilots this autumn. Nursing is not just a job, it\u2019s a vocation, a calling. We want the very best people providing care for the patients we serve and we need to ensure that it is also right for those who aspire to be nurses \u2013 before we spend \u00a370,000 of taxpayer\u2019s money on their training. We are leading work on development of the Care Certificate, recognising that our health care assistants deliver more direct care in the NHS than any other staff group but receiving only a tiny fraction of the education and training resources available. Every university in England will, for the first time, be interviewing all prospective medical students to ensure that we are recruiting for the right values, as well as academic excellence. In June, we published the first ever comprehensive workforce planning guidance for the NHS, setting out a clear and transparent process for the new system that we will run. On 5 December we will publish the first ever Workforce Plan for England, setting out how we will invest our \u00a35bn budget in the NHS workforce to help deliver safer, better care for patients, based on forecasts from providers about what they will need in the future. While working with providers on their future forecasts for this plan, they have already told us about how their immediate employment intentions have changed significantly between last year and this and how they have revised their forecasts in-year, with plans to employ an additional 3,700 nurses by March 2014 as Francis has placed the focus, quite rightly, on patients and the quality and safety of the care we provide. We are leading work to ensure we have the right number of GPs in the future and also piloting ways to make Emergency Medicine more attractive and helping to solve staffing problems in A&Es. The report that was released by Robert Francis QC was shaming for the NHS, laid bare failures for all to see and challenged us all to work together to ensure that we make the changes that were so obviously needed. Problems with values, behaviours and culture were at the root of the issues addressed by Robert Francis and today\u2019s response indicates the changes to the education and training system that we must now make. That is the very least we owe those we serve. HEE is already making a difference to patients and our leading role in both developing and delivering on today\u2019s recommendations will allow us to plan for an NHS that goes into and beyond its 100 th year.

      "content": "29 November 2013 - 10:28 Health Education England is delighted to announce it has achieved one of its mandate requirements early, with more than 100,000 staff providing NHS services having received dementia awareness training. This was one of the priorities in the Government\u2019s mandate to Health Education England which set out plans for education and training for all NHS staff. The mandate includes a focus on ensuring that training is made available to all NHS staff who look after patients with dementia care, ensuring that 100,000 staff have foundation level training by March 2014. In June 2013 Health Education South West was asked to be the lead LETB on behalf of HEE to deliver the national project for dementia awareness training. The South West was able to demonstrate that it had the highest proportion of people aged over 65 and was experiencing high levels of dementia earlier than other parts of the country. The region has specialist expertise including the work of the South West Dementia Partnership and has developed a range of dementia e-learning resources and a website platform to support health and care workers in the region. Health Education South West has worked with all of HEE\u2019s LETBs to develop a picture of how many NHS staff have undertaken dementia awareness training in England and the results show that 109,000 staff have received the training so far. Professor Sarah Watson-Fisher, Managing Director of Health Education South West, said: \u201cThis is great news and shows the importance of staff being aware of the care needs of people with dementia across the NHS. We have discovered many examples of innovative and good practice and collaborative working in all types of care settings. We are looking to build on this work and share best practice with all NHS staff, to ensure that they have the knowledge and confidence to improve the quality of care of people with dementia\u201d. Professor Ian Cumming, Chief Executive, Health Education England said: On average over 800,000 people in the UK have dementia, therefore it is essential that we have a workforce that is able to care for and support those living with the condition. \u201cOur job now is to spread this awareness so that wherever and whenever patients with dementia and their families have contact with the NHS, they can be assured that the staff caring for them can do so in a compassionate way that meets their needs\u201d We will continue to work with our partners across all sectors and settings as we develop plans for a national rollout of training, building on key quality initiatives to make sure that those living with dementia experience a real difference in their care. The Department of Health has published a State of the Nation Report on dementia care and support and a supporting interactive map of variation. The Report and map are available electronically http://dementiachallenge.dh.gov.uk and include published data from a range of organisations. Tweet Categories: Home \u2022 News",

The Francis report recommended that student nurses should spend time working directly with patients before taking up their degree course as part of a call for an increased focus in nurse training and education on the practical requirements of delivering compassionate care and evidence of appropriate values, attitudes and behaviours. HEE recruited 165 potential nurses to the pilots last year and their life-changing experiences have been recorded in a new booklet published today. Emily Minchew, HCA pilot student, Wirral University Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, said: \u201cThere are a number of benefits to this role, for example, it helps you to decide if nursing is really the career for you, and it also prepares you for life as a student nurse, making you more confident in your role. I would recommend it to anyone that would like to get into nursing and believe it offers invaluable experience.\u201d Emma Holt, HCA student, Gateshead Health NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle Upon Tyne said she would recommend the pre-nursing experience: \u201cI would definitely recommend it. I think it is so valuable to have relevant experience before entering university.\u201d The pilot is undergoing formal evaluation. However, the success of the pilots so far has led to the development of a second phase with additional cohorts. Five of the current six pilot sites are planning to recruit more participants in February/March and HEE is working with additional LETBs to introduce further cohorts in September. On Wednesday 19 February Health Education England will be celebrating Pre-nursing experience pilots journey so far at a national event in London. The event will involve hearing directly from the pilot sites and the HCAs themselves, celebrating their stories, sharing and learning from their experiences. Professor Ian Cumming OBE, Chief Executive, Health Education England said: \u201cHEE has been leading these innovative pilots and our work will allow the NHS to be confident that the people starting their journey to become qualified nurses have the right values and behaviours. Their degree-level studies will build on these values and behaviours to ensure they have the right technical skills and academic competencies that we would expect of those we entrust with our care. Our pre-nursing experience programme really demonstrates why HEE exists \u2013 to, above all, improve the quality of care delivered to patients.\u201d Health Minister Dr Dan Poulter said: \u201cRobert Francis recommended that potential future nurses should have frontline, hands-on caring experience before they start their studies.

      "content": "26 February 2014 - 08:50 Health Education England has published its Broadening the Foundation Programme report , which recommends doctors in training undertake a minimum of one community or integrated placement during their two year Foundation Programme. This is to ensure they receive a wider experience of working in community settings, such as general practice, community psychiatry or community paediatrics, palliative care and public health and obtain a broader understanding of community care and the whole patient journey. The report was developed in response to the recommendations highlighted in the Secretary of State commissioned report Foundation for Excellence by Professor John Collins, which called for Foundation doctors to develop their capabilities across a range of settings, including the community and to training a flexible workforce that is capable of providing care across these settings over the course of their careers. The two-year Foundation Programme is designed to give trainees broad general experience before choosing an area of medicine in which to specialise. HEE\u2019s report recommends that services are re-configured within the Foundation Programme to create more experience in community-based settings to ensure that Foundation doctors are trained in a wider variety of community settings so that they are better equipped to provide safe, effective, integrated care for the whole patient, now and in the future. Chris Welsh, Director of Education and Quality for HEE, said: \u201cChanges are required in the current Foundation Programme to ensure that our newly qualified doctors can be trained so that they are better able to respond to future changes in the country\u2019s health and social care system. There are opportunities for both services and doctors to become more patient-centred, more integrated in approach and more effective in meeting the needs of patients, both now and in the future.\u201d \u201cImplementing the recommendations in this report will be challenging, however we\u2019ve worked closely with our local education and training boards, royal colleges, trusts and partners to deliver these recommendations. We all agree that education and training must keep pace with changes in health and social care provision.\u201d HEE\u2019s local education and training boards will now work to implement the recommendations within their areas.

Health Education England (HEE) has today launched a new framework to help pharmacy professionals to improve their skills in carrying out consultations with patients and in delivering public health messages. The framework, developed by HEE, the Centre for Pharmacy Postgraduate Education (CPPE) and key stakeholders across the profession, represents a national programme of change in pharmacy and will apply to more than 60,000 pharmacy professionals across England. This includes pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and pre-registration trainee pharmacists across a number of sectors such as hospitals, community pharmacies, primary care, GP practices, care homes, secure environments and the armed forces. It will also impact on Universities and Colleges who are training the next generation of pharmacists and pharmacy technicians. The framework, which has been endorsed by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society and the Association of Pharmacy Technicians UK, has been structured around the following six questions: Why are consultation and public health skills important for all pharmacy professionals? How do I know what standard is expected of me? How do I know how effective my consultation skills are now? How do I improve my performance? How can I check my learning and development? How do I continue to develop my performance? The key components are a set of Practice Standards for consultation skills in pharmacy, which outline the competencies that pharmacy professionals need to achieve in order to conduct consultations and public health interventions effectively; a learning pathway, which individual pharmacy professionals can follow to develop the consultation skills they need. To coincide with the launch, a CPPE distance learning pack will be mailed to all pharmacists and pharmacy technicians in England; a range of training formats, for example, face-to-face learning, e-learning and printed workbooks. A variety of resources is available for learners, as well as for those who want to deliver learning, such as employers and local training organisations. Those working through the pathway will be encouraged to collect feedback on their consultation skills from their employers and their peers. Specially designed patient feedback forms are available for collecting feedback from patients and customers about medicines-related and public health consultations; an assessment framework which encourages pharmacy professionals to work through a self-assessment process using a structured and validated self-assessment tool to identify their learning needs. There is also an online assessment which uses videoed consultations that pharmacy professionals can access to check their learning and development. The framework has been well received by the pharmacy community, Delyth Higman James, Senior Lecturer and Programme Director, MSc in Pharmacy Clinical Practice (Community & Primary Care), Cardiff School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, said: \u201cThe pharmacy profession has shown over the years that we have excellent communication skills when dealing with patients. However, good consultation skills requires more than this in order to improve patient safety and to be at the heart of patient-centred care. This is an exciting and much needed initiative to make sure that effective consultation skills are adopted across all pharmacy professionals and not limited to pockets of good practice.\u201d Nina Barnett, Consultant Pharmacist, Care of Older People, said: \u201cWe want every patient to have access to the information they want about their medicines, supported by a pharmacist who addresses their beliefs and concerns about medicines, as well as practical issues. The work of this group is pivotal in achieving our aim.\u201d Sneha Varia, Pharmacy Professional Development Specialist, London Pharmacy Education & Training, NHS, said: \u201cProviding a framework that facilitates the shift in balance of responsibility to the patient and encourages the provision of targeted support according to their needs helps ensure patients have ownership of decisions made.\u201d Harriet Lewis, Regional Partnership Manager (North), Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) said: \u201cThe use of the framework will be invaluable to improve the skills of pharmacists and those having detailed conversations with patients to ensure they are able to fully engage with the patient, understand the patient\u2019s thoughts and concerns about their medicines and condition and to advise and support accordingly. By working in partnership with the Pharmaceutical Industry pharmacists can take their rightful place as being the most accessible healthcare profession to give expert advice on medicines and support patients to understand the benefits that their medicines can give.\u201d Christopher Cutts, Professor of Professional Development and Practice Director, Centre for Pharmacy Postgraduate Education said: \u2018This programme of work will support all pharmacy professionals to make a big step forward to supporting patients in the reforming NHS. We need every patient facing pharmacist and pharmacy technicians to work through the six step model and improve their consultation skills\u2019 Pharmacists and pharmacy technicians will be able to access the full range of resources from a new website, www.consultationskillsforpharmacy.com , including guidance, the practice standards, learning options, assessment tools and signposting to support. The website also offers advice to employers and trainers. Tweet Categories: Home \u2022 News",

      "content": "20 March 2014 - 10:56 NHS Employers, in partnership with HEE, has developed a mapping tool for organisations to map their own local values against those of the NHS Constitution. The tool has been developed as part of HEE\u2019s Values Based Recruitment programme which will ensure that selection into all new NHS funded training posts incorporates testing of values based recruitment by March 2015. The new, quick and easy tool is now available for download from the NHS Employers website . Many NHS organisations have worked hard to establish and embed their local values, and the tool has been created to help map these local values against those within the NHS Constitution to ensure that the work already done is built on. As the delivery partner for the employment strand of the VBR programme, HEE is working with NHS Employers to provide support and resources to help providers to recruit staff for values. It is recognised that every organisation is different and a framework will be developed that will best support employers to attract, appoint and retain the right people to the NHS and NHS Employers is working together with partner sites to look at a number of VBR practices, tools and approaches that have been a success. The VBR programme is a priority for HEE, aiming to deliver a system to support recruitment for values for NHS funded training posts and NHS employees, which promotes quality care and positive patient, staff and trainee experience by March 2015. Other projects which make up the VBR programme are Recruiting for Values into NHS funded training programmes and Evaluating the Impact of Recruiting for Values.

Leaders aim to expand significantly programmes of engagement between the MoD and NHS organisations. In a wide-ranging debate, the benefits to healthcare, individuals and national defence were highlighted. Staff who become reservists have fitness checks and receive world-class training that significantly improves their capability in either workplace. The Reservist Summit in Westminster was attended by Anna Soubry MP (Defence Minister), Dr Daniel Poulter MP (Under Secretary of State at the Department of Health) and Major General Jeremy Rowan OBE (Queen\u2019s Honorary Surgeon), as well as representatives of key organisations across the health system, and reservists. Organisations committed to support the objectives of last year\u2019s Ministry of Defence White Paper \u2018Reserves in the Future Force 2020: Valuable and Valued\u2019 which stated that, by 2020, volunteer reservists in the UK will need to make up around 29 per cent of the nation\u2019s defence capacity. Currently over 2,000 NHS staff are trained and registered reservists. Defence Minister Anna Soubry MP said \u201cI am delighted to have attended this summit which has proved very useful in exploring future opportunities for NHS staff to join the Reserves.

After the consultation closes the COF Advisory Committee at NICE will recommend a set of indicators and publish this advice on its website. The NHS Commissioning Board will decide on the final set of indicators for the 2013/14 Commissioning Outcomes Framework in the Autumn.

At the same time, we asked visitors to our stand in the exhibition to tell us how they would like to get information about the Board\u2019s work. We got plenty of valuable insight from this exercise, which we will use from now on. Also at the RCN Congress, many nurses, midwives and student nurses signed up to Energise for Excellence. I have been involved with this call to action for a cou ple of years now so I\u2019m really pleased we have some more new recruits. E4E gives nurses and midwives a range of tools, approaches and measures they can start using straight away to improve the quality of the care they give to people and their families. It also gives you access to a virtual on line community where you can share and learn about best practice.

Increasing female representation will ensure use of talent and increase capacity, enable inclusive, non hierarchical behaviours, create powerful role models, reflect the needs of female patients and help ensure compliance with the Equality Act. Gender diverse boards have improved financial and organisational performance. Action is needed to improve the talent pipeline and overcome complex barriers that impede female medical career progression. The current focus is on clinical leadership; need for new leadership styles; organisational performance; and creation of effective CCGs following authorisation. These all create an unique opportunity and urgent need to address this long standing issue.

The aim of the Framework is to help commissioners understand when competition could be used as an effective way to help achieve the best outcomes for patients. The Framework aims to support the requirement of commissioners as set out in the Health and Social Care Act 2012 to ensure good practice and to promote and protect patient choice. Competition is one of the many tools that commissioners may decide to use to improve services for patients. The content of the Framework will evolve as part of on-going discussion with commissioners to understand what tools they would find most useful. The Framework will be an easy to access suite of inter-related online products, including guidance, interactive tools, case studies and latest news that will be developed under the guidance of commissioners. Get involved The NHS CBA and Monitor are at the NHS Confederation annual conference and exhibition on stands D32 and C12 respectively. Keith Holden from the NHS CBA and Amy Cauldwell-Nichols from Monitor will be holding an eXhibition eXchange session on the Framework and answering questions at the NHS CBA stand (D32) on Thursday 21 June 2012 between 1.10pm and 2.10pm .

      "content": "The NHS Commissioning Board Authority has set out its plan for a small number of national networks to improve health services for specific patient groups or conditions. Called strategic clinical networks, these organisations will build on the success of network activity in the NHS which, over the last 10 years, has led to significant improvements in the delivery of patient care. Strategic clinical networks, hosted and funded by the NHS Commissioning Board (NHS CB), will cover conditions or patient groups where improvements can be made through an integrated, whole system approach. These networks will help local commissioners of NHS care to reduce unwarranted variation in services and encourage innovation. The conditions or patient groups chosen for the first strategic clinical networks are: Cancer Cardiovascular disease (including cardiac, stroke, diabetes and renal disease) Maternity and children\u2019s services Mental health, dementia and neurological conditions These networks will exist for up to five years and will be managed by 12 locally based support teams. These teams will build and oversee effective network arrangements for their area and help networks develop an annual programme of quality improvement in local services. The support teams, funded by the NHS CB, will be located in a local area team office. Full details of strategic clinical networks can be read in The Way Forward \u2013 Strategic clinical networks published by the Board Authority and the supporting document The Way Forward \u2013 Frequently Asked Questions .

      "title": "NHS England \u00bb Babies to get new test for eye cancer in the womb to save their sight",
      "content": "A life-saving test that allows doctors to spot a rare form of eye cancer in babies in the womb is being rolled out by the NHS in England this week. Now, thanks to a new NHS test developed at Birmingham Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s NHS Foundation Trust, babies identified as being at risk of developing retinoblastoma can be monitored and treated sooner \u2013 increasing the chance of saving their eyesight and potentially their lives. Symptoms of retinoblastoma are hard to detect and a diagnosis can normally only be made once the tumour has progressed and the eye can\u2019t be saved. The new non-invasive test can detect changes in the genes in DNA and is likely to identify around 50 infants with retinoblastoma each year, in the latest example of the NHS harnessing the power of genomics to diagnose and treat patients faster and more effectively. Non-Invasive Prenatal Diagnosis (NIPD) also means parents can be informed early in pregnancy if their child is at risk. The blood sample test is taken from the mother before birth and tested and analysed for mutations, which can determine with almost 100% accuracy if the baby will develop retinoblastoma. Treatment can then start on the affected eye as soon as the baby is born, with doctors closely monitoring the other eye for any signs. The test can also predict if the disease might develop in their siblings and will be offered to families where there is a confirmed case of retinoblastoma in the family. On top of the cutting-edge new test, Birmingham Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospitals is also developing a non-invasive post-natal cancer test for retinoblastoma patients using eye fluid \u2013 which can also identify if a patient is at risk from other cancers later in life. It\u2019s hoped that in the future this could be eventually done by a simple blood test. NHS Chief Executive Amanda Pritchard said : \u201cThe introduction of this pioneering new test is fantastic news for babies and their parents, and has the potential to save hundreds of lives over the coming years. \u201cCancer is such a terrible illness and a baby being born with it can have a huge impact on parents and families during what should be an incredibly happy time, but backed by world-class innovation and services like the NHS Genomic Medicine Service, through the Long Term Plan the NHS is developing and delivering more cutting edge treatments like this one to help save lives and keep families together\u201d. Dr Amy Gerrish, from Birmingham Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Trust, who were behind the trailblazing research, said : \u201cThe introduction of this technology of cell free DNA analysis will revolutionise the management of all aspects of retinoblastoma from early detection, selection of the best treatments, identification of family members at risk of retinoblastoma and early detection and treatment of associated adult onset cancers. \u201cWe also believe it will help address the huge discrepancy in retinoblastoma outcome for individuals in high income and low and middle income countries which has been highlighted by the World Health Organisation (WHO)\u201d. Mum Siani Bainbridge, 22, from County Durham, had retinoblastoma herself as a child and feared her baby boy, Oscar, might carry a faulty gene known as RB1 which causes the potentially deadly cancer. But she was relieved when she took part in a new trailblazing test, where doctors were able to spot the previously hard-to-detect disease and allay her concerns with a programme of treatment straight after his birth. Siani said : \u201cThis took away a lot of stress, knowing that if there was going to be anything wrong then he would be helped straight away. \u201cGiven that the tumours were quite severe when he was born, the fact he could be treated straight away definitely affected his outcome. It was nice to know the day he was diagnosed it was ready, set go\u201d. Just a week after being born, Oscar started his cancer treatment, which involved chemotherapy and then laser therapy. While doctors could not save the sight in one eye, they did avoid having the little lad\u2019s eyeball removed. And, crucially he kept his perfect sight in the other one \u2013 as well as avoiding the disease potentially spreading to the brain. Consultant Clinical Scientist Stephanie Allen Consultant clinical scientist at Birmingham Women\u2019s Hospital, said : \u201cAn early diagnosis will allow clinicians to manage, monitor and prepare treatments much earlier which can transform the prognosis for the baby. \u201cIt will also give the family certainty and allow them to prepare for the birth knowing the support the clinical team will give them\u201d. The NIPD is one of more than 15 new tests and amendments being added to the National Genomic Test Directory (NGTD), which outlines the genomic tests available via the NHS in England through the NHS Genomic Medicine Service (GMS). The directory, which is the only one of its kind, covers more than 3000 rare diseases and over 200 types of cancer \u2013 demonstrating how the NHS is a world leader in harnessing the benefits of genomics, the study of the genes in our DNA and their function, to deliver better patient care. Among the other additions to the directory are tests for gene mutations that cause forms of breast and endometrial cancer, acute myeloid leukemia and several rare diseases. A genetic test for a particular type of advanced lung cancer has had a matching treatment recently approved by The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) meaning more effective treatment for patients. Professor Dame Sue Hill, Chief Scientific Officer and Senior Responsible Officer for Genomics in NHS England said : \u201cThis new test is a perfect example of how the NHS Genomic Medicine Service is harnessing cutting-edge technology to deliver genomic tests for cancers like this and many other conditions through the National Genomic Test Directory \u2013 meaning more comprehensive and earlier diagnoses and more targeted treatments sooner for all our patients\u201d. Patrick Tonks, Chief Executive of The Childhood Eye Cancer Trust (CHECT) : \u201cAny developments such as this new diagnostic test which has the potential to allow treatment to be started much sooner and therefore the real potential to improve patient outcomes is very exciting news for babies and for the families of anyone affected by retinoblastoma. We watch with interest as this new development is rolled out across the country\u201d. Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said : \u201cDespite the unprecedented pressure put on the NHS because of the pandemic it is incredible to see continued life-saving innovation taking place, enhancing cancer care and diagnosis even before birth. \u201cEarly diagnosis is vital to ensure these babies are given every opportunity to see, and the best chance of survival. New tests such as these will help clear the COVID backlog, ensuring patients are seen at the right time and provided the right care. \u201dOur 10-Year Cancer Plan will set out how we will lead Europe in cancer care, improving outcomes for patients across England\u201d.

      "content": "Since the publication of this blog John Holden has left NHS England. The aim of this blog is to provide a clear and up-to-date account of the work NHS England is now leading to help improve services for people with congenital heart disease (CHD). When we plan a meeting, or if we have held a discussion, or done some work, whether it is with charities, doctors, politicians or anyone else \u2013 you can expect to read about it here. I will try to strike a balance between something which is easy to read, but which also has enough information for you to follow up any specific points that you want to know more about. If you have any suggestions for improvement please do let me know: use the comments box below. I am unable to respond to every single message but I will take note and I will aim to provide an update to the blog every two weeks. Recent events On Wednesday 12 June 2013 the Secretary of State announced in Parliament that he accepted the advice of the Independent Reconfiguration Panel, that \u201cthe [Safe and Sustainable] proposals cannot go ahead in their current form\u201d. He went on to say that \u201cit is right we continue with this process, albeit in a different way\u201d and that \u201cNHS England now must move forward on the basis of these clear recommendations\u201d. You can read the full text of the debate here . NHS England will now develop a new process to improve services for children and adults, addressing the concerns raised by the Independent Reconfiguration Panel. Patients, families and their representatives We are very keen to begin the conversation with local and national charities, and other stakeholders, about the future of congenital heart services. We know \u2013 because some of you have already been in touch \u2013 that you want to hear about next steps from NHS England as soon as we are able. However we also know that this has been a difficult time for all concerned and there will be a wide range of views about what has happened and what needs to happen. So \u2013 we have decided that we will get some expert, outside help with these conversations. We want to design and plan the best way to ensure that everyone\u2019s voice is heard and that we work together constructively. NHS England is now in contact with three separate registered charities to discuss how they can help us to get this right. They are: Involve \u2013 experts in public participation. They design and deliver high quality public and stakeholder engagement processes. National Voices \u2013 a national coalition of health and social care charities in England, working together to strengthen the voice of patients, service users, carers their families and the voluntary organisations that work for them. Centre for Public Scrutiny \u2013 a charity whose principal focus is on scrutiny, accountability and good governance, both in the public sector and amongst those people and organisations who deliver publicly-funded service. CfPS may be able to help us to learn lessons from the process to date. You can expect to hear more very soon about how we will engage with you. Clinicians and their organisations We want to have productive discussion with the professionals who care for patients, the organisations they work for, and the associations which represent them. NHS England\u2019s Medical Director, Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, is considering the best way to get a balance of expert clinical advice. Bruce will oversee a process of clinical engagement, and amongst other things will consider the potential for obtaining external, international advice. We decided that as a matter of priority we should hold an introductory meeting with the 10 centres/Trusts currently providing children\u2019s heart surgery. This took place in London on Friday 21 June and was attended by all 10 organisations, with most represented by their Chief Executive and/or Medical Director. The key points to come out of the discussion were as follows: Patients and their families come first. The care they experience does not always measure up to the standards we would wish. Many patients and families are now even more uncertain about where their care will be delivered in future. There needs to be a vision of what the future could look like, which explains that we want a high quality service which is future proof. It is right to want to make good services better, and to be more sustainable. But the story so far has been dominated by fear of service \u201cclosures\u201d and \u201closs\u201d. The process must be built on standards, rigour, honesty and transparency. And this must be visible throughout, for example in the use of data and evidence. This should be a national service with national standards, serving the whole population, not a patchwork of regional solutions. Some attendees felt that the \u201canswer is in the room\u201d \u2013 in other words units working together, with effective networking as in other specialties. But this was not a justification for simply prolonging the status quo, with better dialogue between centres. There was real concern about maintaining a viable service, and a real risk of losing good clinicians, or failing to train and recruit the next generation, due to the continuing uncertainty. The role of national professional associations was highlighted, and the importance of their impartiality. And the role of local clinical teams would be critical, both to provide expert input to the review and to give a balanced and honest account to patients and families locally. The NHS England ambition \u2013 to have an implementable solution in a year \u2013 sent the right sort of message about urgency, but was a heroic target. To stand any chance of realising this, any new process must have pace, clarity of sequencing, and all those providers involved must honour commitments made during the process. It was suggested that the process should consider dependencies across the whole of the UK and Ireland. More generally, the new review process would benefit from some international perspective. It was important to consider the whole patient life course \u2013 from ante-natal testing and diagnosis to adult monitoring and interventions The IRP\u2019s report is the starting point for a new process but \u2013 notwithstanding its criticisms of Safe and Sustainable \u2013 there is some good work in Safe and Sustainable that should not be lost. It will however be important to look at the earlier review in the context of 2013 and latest projections of demography, case mix etc. NHS England and other partners The Board of NHS England has established a committee which will provide formal governance of this work. The committee is chaired by Sir Malcolm Grant, our Board Chairman, and includes Margaret Casely-Hayford and Ed Smith (non-executive directors), Sir Bruce Keogh (our Medical Director), and Bill McCarthy (National Director for Policy). To support the Committee, we expect to put in place arrangements which include clinical, organisational and service user representation. Bill McCarthy is the senior responsible officer for this work. As Director of System Policy \u2013 one of Bill\u2019s deputies \u2013 I will co-ordinate the work within NHS England and ensure the full involvement of the many different stakeholders. You can read more about the members of the Board\u2019s committee on the NHS England website . John Holden John Holden was previously Director of Policy, Partnerships and Innovation, since the publication of these blogs he has left NHS England. Topics Heart disease 5 comments Angela Ledsham says: 3 July, 2013 at 2:02 pm I am a nurse working in an intensive care unit that cares for children following surgery for congenital heart disease. As I believe the independant review panel was anything but independant I wish for some reassurance that this time the review will be transparent, truly independant and clear in steps for implementation. After all it seems 6 million pounds was wasted in the previous process. I would like to point out that during the safe and sustainable process we have all striven to give the best compassionate, evidence based and highly competent care for these children. There has been no real acknowledgement of this \u2013 meanwhile we carry on providing the expert care without being able to really develop the service further. You need to understand that the longer the uncertainty continues the more unhelpful it is. I really hope that this time you get it right. I also feel that your panel needs representation from all the clinicians involved in a childs care rather than just the medical professionals. Nurses working on the \u2018shop floor\u2019 are able to contribute if given a chance. It should not just be\u2019clinical experts\u2019 Mary E Hoult says: 3 July, 2013 at 9:51 am The real experts in all this are people like John Illingworth who has tried to follow real process in order to establish proper consultation,I hope it is people like John who are the main stay of any new group being formed to ensure public confidence in the new process.. Andy says: 2 July, 2013 at 2:28 pm \u201cNHS England\u2019s Medical Director, Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, is considering the best way to get a balance of expert clinical advice\u201d We all had enough of experts with undeclared conflicts of interests, sitting on multiple pannels. We cannot accept anymore Professors, ex consultants, current consultants give advice, all with a predetermined mind on which Centre need to close. They have already discredited enough the review. Where are they now? Any comments they want to make to the IRP report? Anyone want to give radio interviews writing articles on local papers, or pontifying how good was the Safe and Sustainable review. No more expert, please. Hazel Greig-Midlane says: 28 June, 2013 at 8:03 pm HeartLine, registered charity 295803, has over 2000 member families \u2013 we support children with heart disorders and their families, whatever the condition, wherever it is treated \u2013 in practice this is throughout UK and Ireland I came across this page by chance (why were we not emailed the details?). It gives a very clear picture of where you are at the moment, and as a parent who drafted the original \u2018standards\u2019 at the time of the Bristol Inquiry gave me a faint glimmer of hope that you will be able to offer the design of the service that we need. Providing safe and sustainable surgical services is an important issue, but I constantly reiterate that most children who die or are damaged have not had their heart condition diagnosed/diagnosed accurately. The major changes must be made in local communities \u2013 we are still collecting signatures at fetes and festivals for a petition for pulse oximetry to be offered to all newborns. (But this is an ego free zone \u2013 maternity hospitals are not going to go to war and consultants will not get kudos from implementation.) HeartLine has been involved in all stages of the review, framed many of the standards, represented the views of members, begged for acquired heart disease to be included alongside congenital, attended all meetings open to parents, provided updates in publications, provided a response to IRP. Seth Edwards says: 1 July, 2013 at 10:41 am Thank you for your comment. We value the work of your charity, and that of all our third sector stakeholders and partners. NHS England\u2019s website has regular updates and new pages are added on a daily basis. We do not as a rule update our stakeholders in advance of these pages being published as we feel this runs counter to the way a website actually works. Our site does offer the option to set up RSS updates for those stakeholders and users who want to be alerted to updates instantly and we also have the weekly news bulletin \u2013 NHS News \u2013 which we encourage everyone to subscribe to.

      "title": "NHS England \u00bb Diffusing innovation in healthcare",
      "content": "Britain has a long and proud tradition of leading medical innovation. The smallpox vaccine invented by Edward Jenner is said to have saved more lives than have been lost in all wars. Sir Ronald Ross won the first British Nobel Prize for Medicine and Physiology for his discovery that malaria was carried by mosquitoes. Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, and Watson and Crick discovered the structure of DNA. Medical innovation has been, and remains, a defining feature of our country. But despite these impressive credentials, the NHS has in the past been regarded by some innovators, both in the UK and abroad, as challenging to enter, navigate and scale across. And, as outlined in NHS England\u2019s Five Year Forward View, state-of-the-art, cost-effective solutions and new ways of delivering care are key to improving the health of our nation. With pressures on the NHS, including an aging population, more long-term conditions, increasing costs and constrained budgets, the demand for innovative solutions that enables better patient care while offering improved value for the taxpayer is growing fast. This is a time like no other to focus our efforts on diffusing new innovation across the healthcare system. To build on this priority, we launched the NHS Innovation Accelerator (NIA) in January, a programme aiming to encourage scale and adoption of innovations in the NHS. The programme will select up to twenty healthcare pioneers along with their tried and tested innovations, both from the UK and internationally, through an open application process, scaling enrolled innovations across parts of the service to improve care and reduce costs. NHS England and the hosts for the programme, UCLPartners and The Health Foundation, in partnership with Academic Health Science Networks (AHSNs) and patient groups, will work with the selected pioneers and NHS organisations to achieve this. To bring global learning to the NHS, the programme will be supported by the International Partnership for Innovative Healthcare Delivery (IPIHD) \u2013 a collaboration including the World Economic Forum, and Professor Victor Dzau, President of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences. Enrolled innovators will receive regional and national support, with access to world-class mentors that include Lord Ajay Kakkar, Lord Ara Darzi, Sir John Burn and Sir Sam Everington. At a personal level, innovation has been a passion of mine for several years because it combines my interests and experiences in clinical practice, research, policy and entrepreneurship. It\u2019s been a fantastic learning experience having only joined NHS England in August 2014. Collaborating on this programme has given me great insight into examples of teamwork and dedication across different departments in the organisation, from communications and media, to innovation and finance. It is this cohesiveness that allows us to deliver quality care to patients across England amid the aforementioned pressures. Innovation is integral to a sustainable and successful NHS, and scaling cutting-edge innovations can improve patient care. If you think you and your innovation fit the bill please apply to be part of the NIA. Applications for the NIA are due February 27. The programme will start in July 2015 with a bespoke accelerator course.

Still less than 10% ? Innovation Health and Wealth, Accelerating Adoption and Diffusion in the NHS OESOPHAGEAL DOPPLER MONITORING (ODM) ODM is a minimally invasive technology used by anaesthetists during surgery to assess the fluid status of the patient and guide the safe administration of fluids and drugs. In March 2011, NICE published guidance on the use of ODM, recommending it for patients undergoing major or high-risk surgery and certain other surgical patients. Despite a comprehensive evidence base, uptake of this technology has been poor across the NHS. Full adoption of this technology across the NHS is forecast by NICE to benefit over 800,000 patients and generate net financial savings of over \u00a3400m. Current information suggests that these technologies are used for less than 10% of applicable patients. \u2022\u2022 We will launch a national drive to get full implementation of ODM, or similar fluid management monitoring technology, into practice across the NHS.

      "content": "Since the publication of this blog Tim Kelsey has left NHS England. When patients are ignored, they are most at risk: that was the central conclusion of the report by Robert Francis QC into Stafford hospital. It has been at the centre of every NHS scandal \u2013 the quality of care is jeopardised if the patient voice is not heard and respected. I recently met a former nurse whose daughter has severe learning disabilities. She was exhausted by the powerlessness and routine indignity of her experience: often she would turn up at the A&E department and wait for hours to be admitted and then wait again for a hoist to arrive by the bedside so that her daughter could be lifted from her wheelchair onto the bed. \u2018I wish they would remember us,\u2019 she says. She complains but her voice has not been heard; her experience as a customer and patient has not improved. It\u2019s not every day, everywhere, for every patient \u2013 most, by far, receive an exceptional service, but to ensure the NHS delivers high quality care for all, we need transparency of the patient and carer experience. It is the absence of this transparency that often allows poor care to go undetected. So today (Tuesday) we are publishing the first results of the Friends and Family test \u2013 the first time a health service has reported a single measure of patient satisfaction for every hospital. Patients and carers have been asked to score (on a six point scale) the quality of service on inpatient wards and A&E in English hospital trusts on this basis: \u2018How likely are you to recommend our ward or A&E department to friends and family if they needed similar treatment?\u2019. Trusts are also encouraged to ask patients further questions allowing them to leave more detailed free text comments to give specific service feedback. From now on, results will be published every month on the NHS Choices website so that citizens can hold local services accountable for improvement. In most cases, nurses and doctors get the feedback weekly so they are able to target improvements as quickly as possible. This is the boldest move yet to promote real openness in the NHS and to concentrate our focus on improvement in care. For a year, a pilot has been running in the Midlands and East region of the NHS in which more than a third of a million people have given their feedback. Frontline staff have been quick to embrace this data as a tool to change things for the better. People complain about standards of cleanliness, isolation, lack of communication and poor food. NHS workers have been able to respond: switch the heating up, provide fruit on the ward, take more time to tell patients what is happening to them \u2013 or simply have a bit of a chat. Mid-Staffs would not have had such tragic consequences if action had been taken on patient complaints far sooner. This kind of routine feedback enables a different kind of conversation between the patient and clinician. We hope that many comments will be complimentary. In Chelsea and Westminster hospital, the vast majority of patients would recommend the A&E; one left a comment along these lines \u2018I was drunk but the staff still treated me with respect\u2019 \u2013 a reminder of the situations extraordinary NHS staff deal with on a daily basis. This kind of information \u2013 user-generated feedback is the jargon \u2013 is now fundamental to the way we make choices as consumers in the rest of our lives. Trip Adviser was launched 13 years ago and has more than 100m hotel customer reviews on its site; customer ratings and comments on retail sites like Amazon have transformed the way in which many people buy things. In New York, more than 90,000 citizens each day feedback on local services and this, according to Mayor Michael Bloomberg, has become one of the most powerful tools the city has to target improvements. The NHS is not a hotel chain nor a city authority: but there are vital lessons it can learn about the power of transparency and feedback. Unleashing the power of people in this way is going to be fundamental to improving outcomes across health care \u2013 and to the effectiveness and sustainability of the NHS. Transparency is not universally welcome in this public service: there are those who will criticise the Friends and Family Test as a measure saying it is crude and not statistical, which is true, but this will be to miss the point \u2013 the NHS is putting the patient voice irrevocably into the mainstream of its activities. By October, we will have extended the measure to all maternity services and by the Spring of 2015 to every service which treats NHS patients. Today we will learn some home truths about the NHS: some Trusts will be surprised by the number of patients who would recommend their services and they will need to take a long hard look at how they quickly transform their customer experience. We will all be watching their progress. We need a transformation in the quality of customer service in health and care: patients must be respected as people. The NHS belongs to us all.

Topics Friends and Family Test Get involved 2 comments termite says: 31 July, 2013 at 1:15 pm Patients are deprived of choice as doctors not triage by phone and we are allocated a doctor. The main reason for this is that doctors are grossly overbooked and cannot meet demand, not because so many patients need help. All kinds of excuses are given by arrogant managers who think they can decide who has a wright to touch us. I have battled for the last six months to see a doctor of my choice, the excuse always being there are no free appointments. With 11 doctors in a practice, how can they claim all appointments are taken, even when you try to pre book \u2026 the list only open two weeks ahead? As a result of not having choice, I have been to A&E 10 times since 18th December and always been given choice / options, seen the same day, x-rays/ blood tests done and often admitted. GP\u2019s create extra demand on A&E because they now decide if they want to see us \u2026 if they can find the time of course \u2026 and thay have a fat excuse book as to why they can\u2019t! an OT user says: 30 July, 2013 at 2:47 pm having been the other side of the professional patient relationship this move is welcomed but I have yet to be asked for my opinion. So far I and my family could write a book on the variations in approach and patient care. I urge all AHPs to take a few minutes to reflect on how their patients see them or could perceive them and the other staff they work with. Don\u2019t be afraid to talk, to challenge, to use empathy you just might make a difference.",

      "title": "NHS England \u00bb Improving communication about gender identity services",
      "content": "Welcome to the first of what I hope will be a regular series of on-line postings about NHS England\u2019s work to improve gender identity services. I have heard directly from individuals and organisations across the trans and non-binary community regarding concerns they have about limited communication from NHS England in relation to this service area. I want to use this blog to start to change that, by talking about the work both underway, and planned, in relation to gender identity services. I hope you find it useful. Firstly, I should say something about my role in relation to gender services. My job is Regional Director of Specialised Commissioning for London, one of four equivalent roles across the country. NHS England is the responsible commissioner for most, but not all, of the services set out in the interim protocol and the draft service specification. As the lead for London I have direct responsibility for services we commission from West London Gender Identity Clinic, the surgical service at Imperial, and the children and young people\u2019s service at the Tavistock Clinic. I am writing this blog in my role as chair of the national task and finish group on gender services. This was set up to support the commitment of the NHS England Board to improve gender identity services, specifically relating to: Inequitable and fragmented access arrangements Variation in services with inconsistent protocols and procedures A need for an individual centred approach to care Long waiting times for assessment and treatment, particularly for genital surgery Poor patient experience in primary and secondary care reported by the transgender communities Many people wait far too long to access gender surgery. NHS England has confirmed that the 18 week referral to treatment time standard set out in the Constitution applies to gender identity services. As a commissioner, NHS England is investing \u00a34.4 million more in additional gender surgery procedures in 2015/16, and will invest more again in 2016/17. We are funding the surgical units at full capacity, which means that the key limiting factor for bringing down waiting times more quickly is the need to recruit and train additional surgeons. The latest available waiting time figures confirm there is still some way to go: the waiting time at Nuffield in Brighton is between four and six months; and at Charing Cross the average is 36 weeks. I propose to use this blog for regular updates on these waiting times. Long waits for surgery have been the first area of focus, but clearly many people are waiting even longer to be seen for the first time at a Gender Identity Clinic (GIC). The task and finish group commissioned a report looking at demand and capacity within each clinic, and the current waiting list numbers and waiting times. This report, which is still in draft as it is being checked with the GICs, highlighted great variability between the different clinics. We are now starting some work with the GICs reviewing their waiting times, and looking at ways in which we can reduce them. I will use this blog to keep you informed on progress with this. In recognition that many of the concerns put to us are outside of NHS England\u2019s influence, we invited a range of national organisations with responsibilities across regulation, standards, training and education and professional leadership, to a symposium. This event in June brought together, for the first time, individuals and representatives from the trans and non-binary community with representatives of a wide range of national organisations, to discuss the problems experienced by trans and non-binary people, many of which are about their day to day experience of general health and care services. The symposium heard some very powerful personal stories from individuals, and attendees identified steps that needed to be taken to improve people\u2019s experience. You can find a report of the event here and a web cast of the event here . The symposium will be followed up with a further event early in 2016, to review progress against the commitments made on the day. Earlier this month, the Select Committee on Women and Equalities held a hearing looking at the commissioning of gender identity services. Dr John Dean, Chair of NHS England\u2019s Gender Identity Clinical Reference Group (CRG), was among the witnesses giving evidence. NHS England has submitted to the inquiry a description of the problems and how we are addressing them. Finally, a \u2018hold the date\u2019 for you: Our next Transgender Network workshop will be held on 3 December in London. Further details to follow. I hope this blog has been helpful, and signals a commitment to improving the way we communicate with you about developments in gender identity services. Please let us know what you think by responding to the blog or via Twitter #NHSgenderid . Will Huxter Will Huxter is Regional Director of Specialised Commissioning (London) at NHS England and currently chair of the NHS England Gender Task & Finish Group.

Because for me and for my daughter the two things are inextricably linked. Yet it shocks me that they should be \u2013 that knowing you are a gender other than that assigned to you at birth \u2013 knowing that as an incontrovertible truth, and wanting to do something about it, should lead inevitably to significant mental health issues I have watched my daughter from the age of 15 onwards suffer crippling anxiety attacks and depression that have led to self-harm, to becoming increasingly isolated and withdrawn and a nervous breakdown. She sat in rooms with a succession of CAMHS specialists who tried to find a solution through Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. When she finally told me that she was a girl, it was a relief to have identified, to have a name for this hitherto nameless issue. When she told her clinical psychologist at CAMHS, she was referred to the Tavistock Clinic in Leeds but told that she had probably missed that year\u2019s intake \u2013 it was 2014, but would be taken on in March 2015. We waited. She rang Leeds in February 2015 and was told no she would not be taken on that year. She spoke to her GP and asked if she could be referred to Nottingham as we had heard they had shorter waiting lists. We think this has happened but she has not heard anything. And since then \u2026 Silence. Nothing has happened, except my daughter\u2019s mental health has deteriorated further. No-one is providing any form of support whatsoever except for continuing prescriptions of Fluoxetin. She has been suicidal but unless she is actually trying to kill herself, when the Crisis team can step in, there is no support other than a referral to Psychology Services in 3 months\u2019 time. My experience of transition is one of a landscape with no pathways, no signposts, no guides or maps, despite the young person having such a strong sense of destination. For the last 2 years she, we, have been utterly lost. So there seems to be no alternative but to go outside the NHS to make progress. We have gone private \u2013 to access an expensive Gender Clinic in London. We may turn to the grey market to access the hormones that she needs. I don\u2019t know what else to do \u2013 watching a young person condemned to a state of limbo is just unbearable. The existing system is utterly wrong \u2013 talking to other parents, I was shocked to hear of the level of bargaining that their transgender children encountered in their treatment \u2013 being told that they wouldn\u2019t be allowed to continue with it unless they continued with their studies; stopped drinking; lost weight; conformed to what was expected of them by this system. I have been shocked to encounter a world that seems so full of confusion, mystery and obfuscation; where it feels that the focus is not on getting the young person to where they want to be as quickly as possible, but rather to condemn them to a state of limbo which can only exacerbate their anguish. To put them in a holding bay, to wait until, it seems, that they have suffered sufficiently to prove the validity of their intent, and where there seems to be just silence and professional fear of trusting what they are saying. I think that as far as Gender transition is concerned, the professional bodies need to take a far more pragmatic attitude to risk \u2013 just as huge public bodies across the land are doing; after all what is the worst thing that can happen if you just believe and act upon what these young people are telling you.

Reply Jane Chaplin says: 28 January, 2016 at 9:25 pm Whilst I appreciat the work being undertaken to alleviate the obvious problems associated with pathways and timescales in this area of NHS work, there is clearly much still to do to help transgender people using local services which are still very much a postcode lottery with excuses given as funding constraints locally for voice coaching whereas other ccg areas happily supporting such essential assistance, as an example. There needs to be urgent work undertaken to ensure this appalling postcode lottery approach does not permeate the NHS providing essential support for transgender people.

I got there due to right sided brain lesion that caused hypersexuality and violence for which the successful treatment is Estrogen therapy (Canadian Institute of Psychiatry) it worked so left without choice I changed gender to survive. Here\u2019s the problem, in 1979/1980 you were made to get treatments the NHS would not pay for, I was made to get private cosmetic surgery simply to stay on the clinical list for contineous treatment, the best I could accpet was half way measures i.e. rhinoplasty but not feminine somewhere inbetween. Facial Feminisation Surgery (FFS) did not exist back then. Looking right, sounding right and presenting well is the difference between being accepted in public without question in the new gender role the alternative is ridicule, verbal abuse, being subject to attack and so on. Many of us of that era were left resourcing whatever finances we had to seek the right medical interventions as the NHS would not assist in a number of areas. I am for the NHS undertaking FFS and would be first in the queue, all the personal finiances were resoruceds to cover treatments I consider to have been part of the pathway to transition. FFS should form part of the protocol for gender re-assigned male to female Trans people. There was little choice and all the savings, pension money and personal finance was used for this purpose, survival depended on it. So for older people that were not allowed to take hormone blockers to prevent the onset of puberty, can they be helped now and have FFS as part of NHS treatment pathway? Reply Clare Turner says: 6 November, 2015 at 3:56 pm I am the mother of a 13 year old trans boy. I feel as though I am on the beginning of a very steep learning curve trying to work out how to support my son and access relevant professional support (never mind dealing with my own feelings on the matter). I have been dismayed by the lack of knowledge and experience from professionals, and the fact that I have been able to find no support for parents of transgender teens. The most useful website/organisation I have found is Gendered Intelligence \u2013 will you be inviting them to your network event in December? In my son\u2019s year at school there are 4 other trans boys who are \u2018out\u2019. The school is trying to learn how to support them.We are lucky in Sheffield that we have an LGBT youth group (at least 75% of the current members are trans). This is currently the only support from a professional with any knowledge of transgender issues that my son is accessing (and as a voluntary youth sector charity presumably its funding is as precarious as the rest of the youth sector). Our GP practice had no knowledge or experience of working with trans young people \u2013 but they are trying to be supportive and were keen to share the research I had done among the practice staff (not really my job to be educating medical professionals when I am looking for support from them!). Following the advice on NHS choices we asked for a referral to CAMHS \u2013 which was rejected on the grounds that CAMHS had no knowledge or experience of this issue, so the GP has referred my son to the Tavistock. I tried to find out what the waiting time was likely to be for the first appointment (left a message on their answering machine, waiting for a reply) and then did some internet searching. Found this document from Leeds and Yorkshire http://www.leedsandyorkpft.nhs.uk/_documentbank/Gender_Identity_Service_Waiting_Time_to_First_Appointment_Offered.pdf \u2013 waiting time has more than doubled from Q1 14/15 to Q2 15/6 (people seen in Q2 14/15 had waited 500 days) \u2013 and the document says \u2018The current waiting list if referred now (October 2015) is approximately three and a half years until first appointment\u2019. This is the adult service \u2013 with only one clinic in the whole country working with under 18s \u2013 how long will my son have to wait to get any support at all from the NHS?

Any help you could give would be appreciated. Thank you. Sophie Reply Anonymous says: 9 December, 2015 at 3:01 pm Hi Sophie, The reason the wait is so long in Leeds is because NHS England only comissioned them to see 160 people per year. Even if they could see more people NHS England would not pay for this. As referrals to Leeds (all GICs in fact) have grown every year this means the waiting list has stacked up. The 160 cap has now been removed and the clinic is looking at ways to get the waiting list down to 18 weeks. This will probably include recruiting and training more staff so may take some time. Hope this helps. Reply Christine in Yorkshire says: 31 October, 2015 at 12:02 pm I returned from living in Australia for the past ten years where I transitioned from male to female. Still Pre op but have lived as a female for the past 8 years. The support I received from the medical community was first class, no waiting to see doctors or specialists. I have been on hormone treatment for all of this time, my health continually monitored. On returning to the UK, I registered with a GP who informed me that despite all my documentation, letters from relevant specialists in Australia, I could not be prescribed hormones. I would have to register with a GIC in Leeds for assessment and any prescriptions. I was informed that a GP can only offer primary care and they do not have the resources or training to support me. They wrote to Leeds GIC for a referral for assessment (I don\u2019t need assessing thanks) and hormone medication which I do. I received a reply from Leeds today stating that they have not as yet put me on their waiting list as it is currently.. Wait for it, 3.5 YEARS So much for 18 weeks. My point is I am 63, just had breast augmentation in Brussels, and will now have to consider overseas surgery for reassignment. I can\u2019t afford to wait 5 \u2013 8 years for the NHS to see or assist me. I think frankly it\u2019s a disgrace, there is no commitment to meet the deadlines, the service is fragmented and post code related. How many more of us are left to deal with life on our own without NHS support? Reply Anon says: 28 October, 2015 at 3:35 pm Dear Will, Thankyou for expressing that there is a problem. I can see that your focus at the moment is bringing down times for surgery, which is admirable. However, due to changes in society more Trans people than ever are asking for help. In my opinion the focus should be made on getting people in to the system (i.e. 1st GIC appointments) quickly. This \u201climbo\u201d period when waiting for the 1st appointment is particularly stressful and frustrating as many people want to get on to the ladder and start to access the support they need (physcologically and hormone prescriptions). Delays in this phase when the \u201cwrong\u201d hormones are acting on the body \u2013 effecting permenant non reversable changes are particularly damaging, whereas the later phases when under endocrinological control are not. I hope you read this comment and understand my point of view Reply anon says: 16 October, 2015 at 11:10 am Why is it that those who still have facial hair post op who no longer suffer Gender Dysphoria are denied electrolysis or laser on the NHS. Through communicating with others, it seems many are suffering the affects of this, yet the NHS refuses to help, it seems cruel that CCG\u2019s across the country are leaving people in this way. It has the affect of many facing verbal abuse, physical attacks and threats, i.e. hate crime, this because the NHS won\u2019t budge on this issue. It\u2019s no wonder many women hate TS people, because they too are denied, I was verbally abused by a lady who had a minor facial hair issue, she assumed I was getting it and she wasn\u2019t, I told her off, I told I too am denied just like her. The NHS should not withdraw vital funding for treatments like this, I now go without heating to fund my own laser, but that won\u2019t help as I need electrolysis too, what do I do to fund that, any suggestions, get my phone & internet disconnected, end my mobile phone contract, leaving me socially exiled, or stop eating all together, maybe that\u2019s the way, starve myself to fund electrolysis, yes, I can see the headline Woman starves herself in cold property because she needed laser and electrolysis NHS England and their CCG\u2019s denied her, but to no avail, she died of starvation and cold, her local CCG and NHS were unable to comment on \u201cindividual cases\u201d disgraceful NHS England.

Apparently te CCG had told her tat was how it had to be done. Earaly March, I went t o Norwich, to be told that yes, I am transsexual, so I\u2019m going to be referred to Nottingam. Then the doctor concened went on holiday for two weeks, so it was the end of March by the time he actually wrote to Nottingam. I am still waiting for my appopintment letter. Apparently, I might get an appointment this side of Xmas. So I might (if I am very lucky) get hormones by the middle of next year \u2014 by which time I will have been living full-time in my new life for a year, without a single shred of effective support from anyone in the NHS. I asked my GP ifshe wouold arrange blood test for me if I self-medded \u2026 but no, apparerntly she \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d even do that! It seems to me that te CCG deliberately misled my GP \u2014 for what motive, I can only guess \u2014 and that the resulting diversion via Norwich has cost me at least three months \u2014 probably more like six months, given that Nottingham\u2019s waiting list went from 6-8 months to 10-12 months in less than a year. Unlike some of my fellow TSs, I don\u2019t think this is necessarily anti-trans bias. I have come across at least one other instance o f a CCG trying to save itself money by deliberately flouting NHSE and DoH procedures and rules(and lying about it) If any other business behaved in a similar fashion, its directors and senior management would be behind bars by now (and I don\u2019t mean serving drinks!) Reply Louise Martin says: 30 September, 2015 at 6:39 am Dear Will, I currently have 3 recommendations for hormones and anti androgen treatments 2 from a private clinic Dr Lorrime & Dr seal , one from Dr Barrett Charing Cross and waiting on Dr Davis recommendation to be typed which normally takes around four months. This will then be 4 recommendations all agreeing that I\u2019m transgender and need to commence treatment. It\u2019s been nearly two years and I have been un able to get treatment, the CCG refuse funding, stating it is the responsibility of NHSE, they redline anti androgen treatments on the traffic light system, the prescribing team also tell my GP they will not recommend this treatment. The CCG say that NHSE do not have a recognised share care agreement, they have the protocol from NHSE regarding roles and responsibilities, but disagree with it and do not recognise it, NHSE do not provide funding for hormone treatments, refer you back to the CCG. no one takes this issue seriously, it\u2019s no ones responsibility , I am left self medicating and can\u2019t even get a blood test as the CCG say they will not provide funding for this neither, I have no where to go, no one to help you are just left with nothing. This has been my experience thus far, which has been incredibly frustrating. Louise Reply Nick says: 29 September, 2015 at 11:15 pm While it is very positive that greater efforts are being made to communicate more effectively with patients about improving gender services, this blog raises more questions than it answers. \u2022 Gender clinics have been allowed for years to mislead patients, fail to meet their statutory duties and violate patients rights under equality law by claiming the 18-weeks to treatment rule does not apply to them. For NHSE commissioners to report they are now \u201cstarting some work\u201d with clinics to review waiting times is a profoundly pathetic and inadequate response to an urgent and chronic problem. NHSE commissioners need to take immediate and determined action to resolve this crisis and force the gender clinics to meet their legal responsibilities to patients. If the clinics were capable of meeting this target without intervention, they would have done so before now. This weak-willed lack of leadership represents an unacceptable neglect of duty on the part of NHSE. Patients have a right to know EXACTLY what is being done NOW to reduce waiting times? \u2022The new funding for surgery is extremely welcome. However, why is this blog utterly silent about increased funding for gender clinics when chronic underfunding is clearly part of the problem regards waiting times? \u2022 There is reference to a lack of experienced surgeons? Where is NHSEs strategic plan on workforce development that will mean adequate numbers of properly trained and experienced staff? Why is there no reference to Health Education England? We do not want the current lobby of psychiatrists inculcating the next generation of clinicians into their distorted attitudes and practices towards trans people. We need a fresh approach to training and workforce development, led by the NHS body supposedly with expertise in workforce development (HEE). This needs to avoid being dominated by a self-interested clinical lobby and include MEANINGFUL IMPUT FROM TRANS PEOPLE. What work is NHSE doing to ensure that there is a fit-for-purpose workforce able to improve clinical standards? \u2022 There is also reference to an independent report based on the work of commissioned consultants examining the gender clinics? What were the terms of reference for this work? What input did trans people have into the development of the commission? Who was commissioned to do it? What expertise or experience do they have in understanding the needs of trans people? What right will patients have to scrutinise the report\u2019s findings and comment on them before final publication? When will the report be published? \u2022 The Symposium event mentioned was very useful but some significant invited organisations couldn\u2019t be bothered to send a representative. Can we look forward to Dame Barbara Hakin (National Director of Commissioning Operations at NHSE) writing to the heads of those organisations to express our profound disappointment and inviting a more involved response going forward? Specifically, these organisations were: the British Medical Association, Health Education England and the Royal College of Surgeons of England. \u2022 Also at a previous NHSE trans network meeting, Dr. John Dean presented a summary of patient and public feedback on the draft service specification being developed but indicated that this had been limited, especially from certain groups such as trans men \u2013 unsurprising since the consultation exercise was poorly publicised. What action is NHSE taking to rectify this in advance of the specification being finalised? \u2022 There is also reference to NHSEs response to the hearing hosted by the Select Committee on Women and Equalities regarding gender services. In the spirit of transparency, may we please have publication ON THIS SITE of the documents or submissions made to that Committee? \u2022 In a final point, as Chair of the NHSE task and finish group for gender services, can Mr Huxter please confirm whether it is correct that there is no patient and public representation on this important group and justify this? How can we rebuild trust and confidence in these processes if key decisions are made behind closed doors in cosy deals between commissioners and provider\u2019s representatives? Nothing about us without us! I trust that we can look forward to a full set of answers to these important questions in the next blog in this series and soon. Nick. Reply Will Huxter says: 2 October, 2015 at 1:24 pm Thanks for your detailed comments. I appreciate your frustration, but we have been open at the Transgender Network Workshop meetings by acknowledging that it will take time to fix things. But that doesn\u2019t mean that we haven\u2019t done anything. Over the past year there has been extensive engagement and planning across NHS England to put remedial measures in place, including a commitment from Board members at the NHS Citizen Assembly. We\u2019ve explained publicly why tackling long waiting times for surgery has been the priority over 2015, resulting in additional investment that now funds the providers at full capacity. And yes, there is more work to be done, including addressing the waiting times in the gender identity clinics, the interface with primary care and young people\u2019s services, and working with partner organisations in the development of a workforce and training plan. Our analysis of current practice in the gender identity clinics represents the first ever attempt by NHS commissioners to tackle the problems that you describe via a concerted, national process. We will present the findings at the Transgender Network Workshop in December. We have asked all of the gender identity clinics to attend a commissioning meeting in October, and we will be open in describing the discussions and outcomes so that both providers and commissioners can be held accountable for progress over the course of our work. Will Huxter Reply Alex says: 27 September, 2015 at 9:33 am While this appears to be a positive step, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve been rendered sceptical by the slow, outdated, punitive approach taken by the entire system of the NHS. Here are a short list of issues I\u2019ve had with GICs, and ones I hope, but don\u2019t expect, that this development will take into account. 1) Inflexibility \u2013 you do it the GIC\u2019s way, or not at all. I knew that for my dysphoria and happiness, I needed surgery prior to hormones. The NHS would not listen to me in the slightest and were talking three years before I could access surgery, and six months on hormones before even discussing surgery. I went private. One appointment later, I have a surgery date booked. Most people do not have that option, and are needlessly suffering because the NHS system refuses to treat their patients with any respect for their feelings. 2) Ignorance \u2013 I asked my GP if she would prescribe hormones on the instruction of a private endocrinologist. She had no idea. Her practice manager had no idea. I gave them the NHS guidelines, they still had no idea. I was referred to the local NHS GIC without my wanting to, because they had no idea. The GIC clearly had no conversation with my GP and have just added me to a waiting list, for a pathway approach not appropriate to my needs. 3) Obstruction \u2013 there is a well-known clinician at the Charing Cross clinic who is famous in transgender circles for refusing to prescribe hormones, no matter the circumstances. Enough said. 4) Waiting times \u2013 four years in Leeds, a friend in Huddersfield was recently told. Four years for a first appointment. That\u2019s four years of completely needless suffering, applied to a group with a stupidly high suicide rate. 5) Punishments \u2013 doing anything unexpected gets you punished. I got surgery privately, so I have to wait longer for hormones, for some reason. I am moving from one GIC area to another, so I have to start right at the bottom of the waiting list again. 6) GIC differences \u2013 they work very differently and all provide different services. They also, like hospitals, come with reputations. Currently, Nottingham is generally considered to be hostile and unfriendly. There isn\u2019t one in Bristol, meaning the entire South West default to The Laurels, sometimes from up to 100 miles away. Pity the folk in Oxford who get to choose from Exeter or London. 7) Referral to CAMHS \u2013 referring to a mental health service just reinforces the idea that transgender people are mentally ill. I appreciate psychiatrists are best placed to diagnose gender dysphoria, but actively referring to CAMHS is a vile approach. Areas that still use CAMHS as a middle man between GPs and GICs need to stop. What would happen if everyone on a GIC list actually demanded that the 18 week target was met? If every single person put in official complaints about having to wait too long, there\u2019d be chaos. If this was the case in any other department, it would be headline news. As it is, nobody cares. The NHS themselves don\u2019t care. There is no support from GPs while you\u2019re waiting, no support from the clinic while you\u2019re waiting, and you wait all that time for a one-hour appointment that does and says exactly nothing. Yet the private sector \u2013 which is just as busy, thanks to the complete lack of services in the UK \u2013 accepted my self-referral in May, diagnosed me in July, and has me booked for surgery in November. I honestly don\u2019t believe you\u2019ll sort any of it out, because to allow it to get to this state in the first place means that transgender people are not on anybody\u2019s priorities list, no matter how low down. The suicide rate will continue to climb, the NHS will continue to drag its feet, GPs will continue to bat transgender patients off, and nothing will change. I hope I\u2019m wrong, but after what feels like fighting a war just to get permission to be me, I doubt it. Reply Will Huxter says: 2 October, 2015 at 1:25 pm Thanks for your email. For me, your scepticism emphasises the importance of NHS England, the providers and other relevant organisations with the influence to change things for the better being open and transparent in the work that we are doing to turn things around so that we can be held to account, and so that you can judge how far we are making progress. I hope that in due course we will have begun to change your mind. Reply Debbie says: 18 September, 2015 at 11:40 pm Please, if you can do just one thing, can you get Charing Cross GIC to pick up the phone, reply to messages left on their answering machine, and write letters in a reasonable time. Never in my dealings with anyone have I come across such poor communications. This seems to go on unchecked year after year and no sanctions are ever applied. Reply NHS England says: 22 September, 2015 at 8:12 am Dear Debbie, We are sorry to hear about the poor communication that you have experienced. NHS England is working closely with the gender identity clinics to improve services, and patient experience, and will raise this issue with the service directly. Kind regards, Will Reply Lola Phoenix says: 18 September, 2015 at 5:01 pm It took me a year to get my first appointment at Charing Cross. I attended a total of two appointments. I have been referred for needing a breast reduction and was encouraged, specifically in the welcome induction I had, that you treat non-binary people. My first appointment with a psychiatrist (I believe) was okay, but she seemed like she knew nothing about hormone treatments and how they work. I have a disorder where I do not make sex hormones, so I take both oestrogen and testosterone. Not having body hair is somewhat dysphoric for me, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m on testosterone. It\u2019s also been improving my mood. The psychiatrist insisted that I had to warn them and tell them if I \u201cdidn\u2019t want a beard\u201d. I reiterated to her that I wasn\u2019t on near enough to grow one but she kept on about it. Someone who\u2019s treating trans people should know that, even those on a full dose of T, beards don\u2019t just spring out of people\u2019s faces. They take a long time to grow and for some people taking T, it doesn\u2019t even happen. My second appointment, 6 months later, went well \u2013 or so I thought. Dr. Davies seemed willing to help me and I eagerly awaited his communication. I received, a month later, a discharge letter that was pretty offensive and horrible. Not only did they manage to not even spell my name correctly, but Dr. Davies didn\u2019t bother asking me what my pronoun was and just assumed that because I have a feminine name that I\u2019m okay with being called \u201cshe\u201d. I had told them I could do nothing about being mistaken as female, regardless of what my name is and I\u2019m resigned to the fact that this society will never see me for who I am \u2014 Mr. Davies wrote that I was happy with that. Happy =/= resigned. It doesn\u2019t make me happy but I can\u2019t do anything about it. Changing my name to something neutral will not solve it. Being mistaken for a man is not the same as being recognised as an agender person!! Additionally, Mr. Davies got my chest size wrong and defined me as presenting as female based on having shoulder length hair. If shoulder length hair makes you female, then there\u2019s a load of guys who are fans of heavy metal that are in for a lesson. My treatment was horrible. And I have no other recourse but to be re-referred, which could take another year. I have emailed a group to complain but no one has got back to me. It would be one thing to be turned away because no one has the funds, but to be denied because my name is too feminine is, point blank, ridiculous. Not to mention, Dr. Davies didn\u2019t even bother asking me if I was going to pursue a name change. Who cares if the waiting times are better if your assessment of how \u201cserious\u201d someone is about wanting surgery is based on outdated gender roles from the 50s??? I feel like a complete dolt given the fact that I was so confident Charing Cross would help me. And I told other non-binary people with confidence that I believed be helped. Only after 2 years, I was discarded like trash with absolutely no understanding or regard for how these past 2 years of waiting has affected my mental health. I sincerely hope you can fix the GIC\u2026 but you have your work cut out for you. Reply NHS England says: 22 September, 2015 at 8:14 am Dear Lola, We are sorry to hear about your poor experience. I cannot comment on an individual case on a public blog, but we see that you have made a complaint and have not received a response. It is not clear to us whether the complaint was made to NHS England or to the service. In case it\u2019s helpful, the process for making complaints to NHS England is described here: https://www.england.nhs.uk/contact-us/complaint/ Kind regards, Will Reply Freya Finch says: 17 September, 2015 at 4:43 pm Thank you for coming forward with this presentation and its proposals. It will be necessary for us to know what is actually moving forward and what is not. Much as I completed the initial form covering transgender issues for the Task & Finish group earlier this year, there is little talk and thus consideration for the undervalued Facial Feminisation surgery (FFS). This happens to be misunderstood and categorized incorrectly by the NHS. I would like to see more discussion and focus concerning the value and importance of this \u201cvital\u201d option. In particular its overall general need as well as specifically how much it positively affects the lives of Trans-females. Further, the training of general staff in their conduct towards service users and their training about recognising specific Transgender matters and concern. Thank you once again. Reply NHS England says: 22 September, 2015 at 8:17 am Dear Freya, The detail of what, it is proposed, NHS England commissions as part of the gender identity services pathway was the subject of public consultation in March 2015. The proposed service specification can be found here https://www.engage.england.nhs.uk/consultation/specialised-services-consultation . Please note that this consultation is now closed. We are currently reviewing the evidence around elements of the proposed service specification before making a final decision. The training of staff and cultural awareness were certainly themes identified during discussions on the day of the symposium, and are issues which we will working through, with partner organisations, and will return to at a future symposium event. Kind regards, Will Reply Nina Hnannagan says: 17 September, 2015 at 7:12 am How long will it take to actually implement change within the NHS around gender services? I work in the NHS and my daughter is a gender patient. I have been frustrated and angered each time we have had contact from the local MH services (who openly admitted they knew nothing about \u201cgender problems\u201d) to the Tavistock clinic to GIC Charing Cross where we are now. I have learnt a lot and now have to chase up every letter back to GP when there is a change in medication. I have to work out and infer what has been discussed so I can put it into action for my very preoccupied daughter who is an emotional and mental wreck because of this journey she has had to go on. I have come across a coupe of individuals who are brilliant but on the whole Gender is the worst service I have encountered both professionally and privately. Time for a revolution. Take Gender out of MH sphere and give it its own service. Set up a centre of excellence somewhere in the country (preferably easy to access for people without cars as a lot of gender pts don\u2019t drive) and then, once the model is working, repeat this in satellites across the country so people can access the same level of service everywhere. There are too many variations currently. All clinicians and especially GP\u2019s should spend time learning about gender so they don\u2019t just commence pts on SSRI\u2019s without knowing anything. Drugs don\u2019t make gender issues go away! They just make pts more lethargic and less likely to engage with people and services. I attended a symposium on local MH services in my area about 7 years ago and the changes we talked about and came up with have still not been implemented. I attended another event more recently and we discussed the same issues again. Change for gender should be patient led and directed. The number of complaints raised in this area should have brought about some change if the service was truly working. My daughters journey is far from over and her family are with her each step of the way to ensure people do their job properly. There are many people who have been rejected by family, friends and the NHS, who do they turn to for help and support? Reply NHS England says: 22 September, 2015 at 8:19 am Dear Nina, Certainly the variability in how the clinics operate is something that we have been looking at over the past few months, and the clinics have been asked to attend a meeting with NHS England in October so that we can begin to shape the work needed to improve the way in which these services are delivered and commissioned. You also raise the issue of training on trans-health issues for the wider professional workforce, and this is something that is being discussed within the symposium work programme. We will keep you updated about this work via the blog. Kind regards, Will Reply Miss Jennifer Dean says: 17 September, 2015 at 3:17 am Dear Mr Huxter, I welcome your blog, and hope that you can use it to provide greater transparency about gender counselling, hormones and treatment times available on the NHS. I was referred in mid-February to the Laurels GIC in Exeter. Assuming a four-to-six-week wait between appointment letter (which I have yet to receive) and actual appointment with a counsellor, I will have waited at least EIGHT MONTHS to be seen. This may be part of the reason behind our 41 percent suicide rate. I do not wish to become part of that tragic statistic. Anything that you can do to get that waiting time down will save lives. The discrimination that I face during my transition is relentless, and every day makes me feel more vulnerable. Please help us all to get professional support as soon as possible. Thank you. Regards, Jennifer Dean (Miss). Reply NHS England says: 22 September, 2015 at 8:21 am Dear Jennifer, Your point is well made, and reflects similar concerns that have been highlighted to us at the Transgender Network meetings. We are conscious that long waiting times can leave people feeling vulnerable. So, we want to bring waiting times down as quickly as we can, and also ensure that appropriate and accessible local support is available to everyone who needs it. We will keep you informed about our work in this area via this blog. Kind regards, Will Reply shyelee moore says: 16 September, 2015 at 11:21 pm hi i was wondering , i went to see my doctor , about six months ago and told her about i want to start transtioning from female to male , i then got sent to mr ball from norwich , then he sent a letter to northumbland which ive now got to wait , for annipointment , as it could take 9 months to a year , ive been like a boy for 40 years ive know it since i was 5, i came out as soon as my son was 18 , so he wold understand , ive told all my family and work , ive changed my name , by depol , work know s. about my name change so dose family , ive waited all these years to come out , as it had been very hard for me to come out in my younger years , as i have been throught allot , trying to pretend , im some one im not , its a waiting game now , very frustrating , as im ready to change have been for years , but i just need to start the injections but have to go throught the prosess of seeing more doctors , its just so time consuming on waititng to see them , when i know what i have wanted for years , im ready but can not do nothing , is there something you can help me with , i live in Norwich. Reply NHS England says: 22 September, 2015 at 8:22 am Dear Shyelee, Thank you for taking the time to write and share your experience. I cannot comment on your individual case, of course, but it does highlight the reasons why NHS England is trying to reduce waiting times as soon as we can. Kind regards, Will Reply Claire Mackay says: 16 September, 2015 at 9:24 pm Is the Transgender Network meeting open to individuals to attend and will this blog be the best place to keep up to date with details of the next meeting? I say this I often seem to here about these type of events after they have happened and, as a transgender person, there seem to be organisations involved in these but, as one of the individuals concerned, I\u2019ve never found the opportunity to get involved and give my own view. Reply NHS England says: 22 September, 2015 at 8:24 am Dear Claire, The Transgender Network meetings are, unfortunately, limited in terms of the number of people able who can attend. In the main, attendees are invited individuals who are representing wider groups of transgender and non-binary people. We are, however, really keen to work with both individuals and groups/organisations. If you are interested in getting involved please let us have your contact details by emailing england.voice-scgd@nhs.net . You can also sign up for regular updates about the work we do and how we are seeking citizen voice and participation \u2013 https://www.england.nhs.uk/publications/bulletins/in-touch/ Kind regards, Will Reply Kate Brennan says: 19 October, 2015 at 2:11 pm Dear Will, I think the Transgender Network Meetings are a great idea. I also appreciate that there\u2019s a limitation of how many such a meeting can accomodate. However, there\u2019s a widespread feeling that the views of individuals on the ground, are not adequately represented. While it\u2019s fine to have representatives from well known organisations which of course have an important role to place in the process there\u2019s seems to be no voice for an individual such as myself. Could some places not be made available in advance for individual participants? Could you also please email me at the above address as I have a few other points I\u2019d like to share. Thanks Kate Reply Juniper says: 16 September, 2015 at 5:33 pm \u201cMany people wait far too long to access gender surgery. NHS England has confirmed that the 18 week referral to treatment time standard set out in the Constitution applies to gender identity services.\u201d From which referral is this supposed to be from for Gender services? First one re gender with the GP, first with mental health services. first with the gatekeeper psychiatrist? As all of these applied to us, and at none did we feel we would see any appropriate service within a year let alone 18 weeks. Reply NHS England says: 22 September, 2015 at 8:24 am Dear Juniper, Thanks for your question. A number of people have asked us to clarify how the 18 week Referral to Treatment standard is applied to gender identity services, and we will do this in a future blog. Kind regards, Will Reply Noah Slater says: 16 September, 2015 at 4:42 pm I hasten to add: thanks for the blog post though. positive step forward \ud83d\ude42 Reply Noah Slater says: 16 September, 2015 at 4:30 pm please stop saying \u201ctrans and non-binary people\u201d trans is an umbrella term that includes non-binary people. a trans person is anyone who\u2019s gender differs from the gender they were designated at birth separating out non-binary people from \u201ctrans\u201d as an adjective delegitimises non-binary people\u2019s transness while reifying exclusionary binary trans narratives about \u201ctrue transexuals\u201d a better way to communicate what I think you\u2019re trying to communicate might be \u201cbinary and non-binary trans people\u201d or some variation on that thanks \ud83d\ude42 Reply Lola Phoenix says: 18 September, 2015 at 4:51 pm Some non-binary people do not identify as trans, though. Reply NHS England says: 22 September, 2015 at 8:26 am Dear Noah, Thanks for the feedback. We have started to do some work regarding language and terminology in this area, and we will involve members of the Transgender Network in developing that. We are at a very early stage, but will keep you informed about progress via this blog. We will also look at this issue in more depth at the next meeting of the Network in December. Kind regards, Will Reply Sahra Taylor says: 16 September, 2015 at 4:22 pm The first thing you could do is stopping GICs from using punitive and punishment-led language in all communications. Endlessly we are told that we must do this or that or we will be removed entirely from the process and have to start again. When you couple this with the endemic level of lost reports, letters and correspondence, people in the system are repeatedly forced to start again through no fault of their own. Endlessly, in a variety of forums, those within the system complain and suffer from the inability of the GIC to keep the patients informed of their position within the system. The refusal of the GIC to accept detail changes over the phone, and the quite frankly ludicrous difficulty in actually contacting the GIC, leads to easily preventable problems. Reply NHS England says: 22 September, 2015 at 10:48 am Dear Sahra, Thanks for your feedback, and I\u2019m sorry to hear about your poor experience. We are trying to improve communications between the NHS and people who use gender identity services. The production of this blog is a first step. We are aware of people\u2019s concerns regarding use of language, and wider communications issues, across the NHS, and and the Board of NHS England got to hear these concerns directly at the NHS Citizen Assembly last autumn. Improving communication is a priority for NHS England, and we will be working through how best to do this, in partnership with service users. We will keep you updated about progress via this blog. Kind regards, Will Reply",

      "title": "NHS England \u00bb Busiest November ever as new figures show pressures on NHS staff",
      "content": "NHS staff answered the highest number of 999 calls for any November on record, an average of around one every three seconds, new figures revealed today. Last month was also the second busiest November on record for A&E with more than two million patients seen at emergency departments and urgent treatment centres. That was up by half a million on the same time last year. Demand for NHS 111 services also remained high, with almost 1.4 million calls answered during November, the latest available figures show. And hardworking NHS staff are continuing to make progress on elective activity with almost 150,000 more people starting elective treatment in October compared to the same month last year. Patients on the waiting list are prioritised based on their need and at the end of October, were waiting an average of 12 weeks to begin treatment, compared to a high of 19.6 weeks on average in July last year. The data comes as cases of Omicron increase throughout the country, and the NHS is urging the public to get their booster when invited. New weekly data , published for the first time this winter, also shows that, on average, there were 10,500 patients each day last week who no longer needed to be in hospital but were not discharged that day, with pressures outside hospitals also high. This means that more than one in 10 beds were occupied by patients who were medically fit to leave. NHS national medical director Professor Stephen Powis said : \u201cThese figures show that NHS staff are continuing to address the COVID backlog in the face of sustained pressure on urgent and emergency care. \u201cAs we head into a very challenging winter, we are working with partners in social care to get as many patients who are fit to do so home for Christmas, which is right for them and their families as well as freeing up beds. \u201cThere is much we do not know about Omicron but experts advise that vaccines will still help in our fight against the virus. \u201cThanks to the efforts of staff and volunteers the NHS COVID vaccination programme has delivered more than 100 million jabs, so do come forward when it is your turn\u201d. In October, staff performed more than 1.9 million diagnostic tests \u2013 over 120,000 more than in October 2020 \u2013 and the average waiting time for one of the key checks, including MRI scans and endoscopies, now stands at 3.1 weeks, down from a peak of 8.6 weeks in May 2020. Cancer care continues to be at pre pandemic levels with more than 225,000 urgent referrals and over 25,000 people starting treatment in September. This is on top of efforts to accelerate the NHS COVID-19 vaccination programme in line with new JCVI guidance with the aim to offer all adults the chance to book their booster jab by the end of January next year. So far, over 100 million doses of the vaccine have been administered since the NHS made history in December 2020, when Margaret Keenan became the first person to receive a COVID jab outside of clinical trials. More than 39 million people have had two doses of the life-saving jab and more than 18 million boosters have been delivered so far. Background More than 879,000 calls to 999 were answered in November. The previous high for November was 794,516. In the week ending 5 December, the NHS had on average 90k adult general and acute beds open. On average over the week, 10,500 were occupied by patients fit to be discharged each day. The 10,500 is from a smaller subset of data, so the true number may actually be higher.

We are responsible for using this money wisely, fairly and transparently to secure the best possible outcomes for both patients and the taxpayer. We allocate most of this funding \u2013 \u00a3107.8 billion \u2013 for commissioning local health services. A further \u00a329.8 billion is spent on directly commissioning services including some primary care services, specialised services and public health. The remaining funds are allocated to the delivery of service development and improvement programmes, in line with our corporate priorities, and NHS England\u2019s core administration and programme costs.

Our programme costs are focused on the delivery of our corporate priorities and this year we have a funding envelope of \u00a32.5 billion. Approximately \u00a30.13 billion is allocated to pass-through costs to fund clinical excellence awards. This leaves \u00a32.4 billion (excluding \u00a30.1 billion depreciation) for direct investment by NHS England to deliver on the commitments outlined in this business plan.

I have been involved with the programme since March 2015 and it has been fantastic to be able to support the vanguards as they have grown and developed. I am also pleased that I will be continuing as the national lead for the multispecialty community provider (MCP) model, so I am very familiar with what is often a complex area of work. I\u2019m passionate about the NHS and I bring more than 20 years\u2019 experience working in the service. During that time I\u2019ve worked at board level across both commissioner and provider organisations, including commercial director of an acute foundation trust and chief executive of an organisation going through transition. Over the past two years I have been lucky to work with a hugely enthusiastic and talented programme team that has a diverse range of backgrounds and skills. One thing I have never forgotten is how much of a privilege it is to work on a programme that aims to deliver a positive impact on the lives of people who use health services up and down the country and those who work within the heath and care system. The NHS has its challenges but the vanguards have been proving it is possible to break down boundaries and build bridges across organisations, to unite services and people around the delivery of better health and care services for the population that they serve. The sites are now showing the impact of their work and this makes our third year an incredibly exciting time for us all. Our ambitions for 2017/18 are clear and I have every confidence that as a team we can deliver, cementing the programme as a major driver for transformational change across health and care. A key priority is to support the vanguards in delivering their care models and demonstrating a measurable impact on emergency admissions (and other key metrics) for their populations, while embedding the robust methods of evaluating our progress and ensuring this information is shared across the country. I also want to see a self-sustaining infrastructure for the continued development of new care models, meaning that others can pick up the mantle and continue the good work long into the future. It goes without saying, however, that none of these ambitions would be achievable without collaboration and team-working. And this goes beyond those working within NHS England. It is important that we continue to build on the enduring relationships we have with staff and patients within the vanguards as well as the arm\u2019s length bodies across the country, so we can all reap the benefits of our shared knowledge and experience. Louise Watson Louise joined the new care models programme in 2015 as the national lead for the multi-speciality community provider (MCP) care model. In June 2017, she became the Director of the new care models programme and is leading on the implementation of the new care models outlined in the NHS Five Year Forward View. Louise has over 20 years\u2019 experience working in the NHS. During that time she has held Board level roles spanning both health commissioners and providers.

      "content": "The workforce is at the heart of the NHS. NHS staff showed enormous dedication and resilience during the pandemic, and it is vital that we continue to support their wellbeing so they can recover and continue to provide the high quality of service patients require. A key part of our strategy to increase the workforce is the ethical recruitment of nurses trained outside the UK, who bring their valuable skills to the NHS and enhance the wider nursing workforce with their experience and expertise. International recruitment is vital for the ongoing management of COVID-19, the transition from response to recovery of services, and other service pressures. During 2022/23 we will also work with the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and Health Education England (HEE) to develop a workforce strategy that builds on the 15-year strategic framework developed by HEE and the NHS People Promise and People Plan. Our commitments for 2022/23 Attract and retain more people Support NHS trusts to recruit nurses, midwives and allied health professionals (AHPs), including by increasing international recruitment. Support the creation of bespoke multidisciplinary teams through the Additional Roles Reimbursement Scheme. Simplify and make recruitment processes quicker, ensuring they are fair and inclusive. Work with the DHSC to deliver pension reforms, reducing the number of staff retiring early. Working differently Support the adoption of interoperable e-rostering, the Digital Staff Passport and the NHS Staff App. Respond to the leadership recommendations in the Messenger review. Compassionate and inclusive culture Support the development of whole system plans that include approaches to protecting and promoting the health, wellbeing and safety of staff, embedding a compassionate and inclusive culture. Revise the fit and proper persons requirements and work with the Care Quality Commission (CQC) to update the \u2018well-led\u2019 framework. Deliver an inclusive board support offer to NHS organisations to promote board-level diversity.

However, the COVID-19 pandemic has had significant consequences for mental health. COVID recovery in mental health is not limited to clearing the \u2018backlog\u2019; it also requires finding ways to manage increased prevalence, acuity and complexity. These pressures have widened the treatment gap for people with a mental health condition and addressing them will require sustained effort to further transform and expand mental health services. Our commitments for 2022/23 Expanding access and recovering performance standards Support the continued rollout of crisis services. Further increase access for children and young people (CYP) aged 0 to 25 years through mental health support teams and community mental health services. Expand access to Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) and continue the expansion of the workforce. Work across all systems to support demand and capacity management in light of increased prevalence, including supporting the recovery of waiting times standards in CYP community eating disorder services. Supporting new models of care Support the delivery of new models of community mental health services integrated with primary care and increasing the number of adults and older adults with severe mental illness (SMI) who receive care.

Learning disability and autism The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the physical and mental health of people with a learning disability and autistic people, children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND). This means there is much more to do to improve the physical and mental health of people with a learning disability and autistic people, including by ensure they have access to reasonably adjusted care across the NHS. Our commitments for 2022/23 Support further development of community alternatives to help reduce the number of people with a learning disability and autistic people in mental health inpatient care. Support the delivery of keyworkers for children and young people at risk of admission to a mental health hospital or who are in hospital to ensure a key keyworker service in all integrated care systems (ICSs). Support the improved uptake of learning disability annual health checks (for eligible people aged 14 and over), supporting innovations in autism diagnostic pathways to improve quality and access, and delivery of the LeDeR programme . Ensure that reasonable adjustments are provided to support accessibility for autistic people and people with a learning disability, including the ongoing development of the reasonable adjustments digital flag and pre and post-diagnostic support.

We will continue to support improvements in the quality of care for children and young people and better integrate services, both within the NHS and with partners across public health, children\u2019s social care and education. Our commitments for 2022/23 Support local systems to integrate services for children and young people. Improve care for long term conditions such as asthma, epilepsy and diabetes, including delivery of the national asthma care bundle. Continue the roll-out of \u2018Complications from Excess Weight Clinics\u2019 for severely obese children. Develop person-centred and age-appropriate care for mental and physical health needs rather than a transition to adult services based on age. Harness the voice of young people through the NHS Youth Forum and ensure we improve the patient experience for young people. Tackling health inequalities We continue to support the NHS to realise the ambition of reducing healthcare inequalities through equitable access, excellent experience and optimal outcomes for all. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted and exacerbated existing health inequalities, with its disproportionate impact on people and communities already at highest risk. Central to restoring services inclusively is NHS action at scale and pace to protect those at greatest risk by tackling health inequalities. Our commitments for 2022/23 Support the reduction in health inequalities through the Core20PLUS5 approach, including through national programmes like the Core20PLUS connectors, collaborative and ambassadors. Develop and publish the National Healthcare Inequalities Improvement Strategy and associated delivery plans. Develop and implement the integrated care systems (ICSs) Health Inequalities System Accountability Framework. Develop and publish a menu of evidence-based interventions for reducing healthcare inequalities. Screening, vaccinations and non COVID-19 immunisations Under Section 7a of the Health and Social Care Act 2012, we are responsible for the commissioning of national screening and immunisation programmes, including those for bowel and breast cancer, cervical screening, childhood immunisations and the influenza vaccination. Their uptake decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, and we are now working to restore these services, as well as expanding eligibility, improving the detection of cancers and implementing plans to address health inequalities in uptake. Our commitments for 2022/23 Screening Implement targeted recovery support packages for challenged providers of breast, abdominal aortic aneurysm and diabetic eye screening. Implement and roll out targeted initiatives to support an increase in the number of women taking up their screening offer. Develop and deliver a strategy for the NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme which includes an age extension and people with Lynch syndrome, and supports wider uptake improvements to address inequalities. Develop and deliver the Cervical Screening Programme strategy to better understand and support improvements to address health inequalities. Vaccinations Implement the national measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine call and recall for children aged 1 to 6 years. Support catch up programmes that use alternative delivery methods for MMR and school-aged immunisations. Improve access to better target unvaccinated individuals and tackle health inequalities. Prevention programmes We will continue to support the delivery of evidence-based NHS prevention programmes to optimise care for cardiovascular disease (CVD), and reduce smoking, obesity and alcohol intake. Our new services will maximise diagnosis and treatment of CVD and help more people to stop smoking, maintain a healthy weight and keep their alcohol intake to under a healthy limit. Our commitments for 2022/23 Support the NHS to increase the number of people supported through the Diabetes Prevention Programme. Expand the Digital Weight Management Programme. Continue to roll out inpatient and maternal tobacco dependence treatment services in line with agreed ICS-level trajectories.

      "content": "Transforming care through harnessing information and technology The overall strategy for technology in health and care is to digitise services, connect them to support greater integration and, with these foundations, enable service transformation. The government\u2019s Digital Health And Care Plan, soon to be published, will set out a vision and action plan for digital transformation. We are working with colleagues in NHS Digital ahead of NHS Digital\u2019s incorporation into NHS England next year. Our commitments for 2022/23 Continue to invest in the foundations for digital maturity, such as electronic records, infrastructure and connectivity across health and social care. Establish digital, data and technology talent pipelines and improve digital literacy among leaders and the workforce. Build on the basic shared care records in place in all integrated care systems (ICSs) to increase the range of organisations that can connect to them, and begin work to enable individuals, their approved carers and their care team to view and contribute to the record. Support ICSs to implement a population health and planning data platform and business intelligence tools. Support the publication of a Cyber Security Strategy for Health and Social Care that will help all parts of the health and social care system build resilience to cyber-attacks, including to safeguard people\u2019s private information. Support local NHS and social care organisations to manage cyber risk and ensure compliance with national cyber standards in each ICS and NHS region. Supporting the NHS\u2019s Net Zero ambition The NHS is tackling climate change and air pollution head on, saving lives and delivering high quality, cost-effective care for our patients. The Health and Care Act 2022 makes clear that this is a priority for every trust and ICS, and they are meeting this challenge; all have developed their own, localised Green Plan. Our commitments for 2022/23: Support energy efficiency and renewable energy schemes as part of the Public Sector Decarbonisation Scheme. Introduce a 10% weighting in all tenders for net zero and social value. Optimise the prescription and use of inhalers to improve outcomes from asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Establish integrated care boards and support collaborative system working Integrated care systems (ICSs) are partnerships of organisations that have come together to plan and deliver joined up health and care services, and to improve the lives of people who live and work in their area. Following several years of locally-led development, the Health and Care Act 2022 established 42 ICSs across England on a statutory basis on 1 July 2022. Each ICS includes: an integrated care board (ICB): a statutory NHS organisation responsible for meeting the health needs of the population, managing the NHS budget and arranging the provision of health services in the ICS area an integrated care partnership (ICP): a statutory committee jointly formed between the ICB and all upper-tier local authorities that fall within the ICS area to align strategy with wider partners. Our commitments for 2022/23 Co-produce the long-term ambition for how ICSs work and build understanding of how ICSs can best support the delivery of NHS commitments and local strategies for improving health and wellbeing outcomes. Finalise statutory guidance on ICS establishment and partnership arrangements, and continue to develop and shape the wider policy framework for ICSs. Support the development of partnership arrangements within ICSs, including with the voluntary, community and social enterprise (VCSE) sector, social care providers and Healthwatch. Co-design and deliver the model for system engagement and communications, as well as ongoing leadership development and support as agreed with ICSs and ICBs. The integration of NHS England and NHS Improvement The passing of the Health and Care Act 2022 enables the legal merger of NHS England and NHS Improvement on 1 July 2022. Our ambition is to create a single organisation united in focus and purpose. In consolidating the considerable expertise, knowledge and experience each organisation brings, we will ensure that we are best placed to tackle the challenges facing the NHS and deliver even better for patients, colleagues and wider communities. Subject to the passage of secondary legislation, and in collaboration with the Department of Health & Social Care, we will prepare for the legal merger of the new NHS England, Health Education England, and NHS Digital, expected in 2023. Our commitments for 2022/23 Merge NHS England and NHS Improvement. From 1 July 2022 NHS England and NHS Improvement will be named NHS England. Design the new NHS England, including how we will organise ourselves to deliver the new organisation\u2019s priorities and the opportunities available to us through bringing the organisations together, and our operating model. Shape our new culture to make NHS England a great place to work for our people and help us achieve our inclusion, diversity and wellbeing ambitions.

We operate under a democratic mandate from government, and our mission, with our partners, is to improve health and secure high quality healthcare for the people of England, now and for future generations Since 2019, NHS England and NHS Improvement have worked as a single organisation to better support the NHS to deliver improved care for patients. On 1 July 2022 we formally merged into a single body, NHS England, responsible for providing unified, national leadership for the NHS. We have started a programme to bring together, from April 2023, NHS England, Health Education England and NHS Digital into a new single organisation with a shared purpose \u2018To lead the NHS in England to deliver high-quality services for all\u2019. The new NHS England will be an organisation that can speak with a single national voice, enabling and supporting change with the flexibility to respond quickly to changing demand, priorities and opportunities. Our mandate from government sets out three key missions over the course of 2022/23: the continued COVID-19 response, recovery of the health system, and driving forward the transformation of services that will improve health and care outcomes. It is an ambitious programme and the NHS England Board will oversee its implementation to ensure we make real progress for the patients and populations we serve. Together with my colleagues on the NHS England Board, I wish to place on record our deep appreciation for the extraordinary efforts of NHS staff across England in ensuring that the millions of people every day who use health services receive excellent care.

In 2022/23 the NHS will continue to restore services, meeting the new care demands and reducing the care backlogs that are a direct consequence of the pandemic. The NHS also needs to manage the material additional costs caused by inflationary pressures. This includes meeting the cost of the pay increase for 2022/23 above the level included in mandate funding. These additional costs mean NHS England has had to scale back national programme budgets and to release reserves. COVID-19 is still with us in 2022/23 and still needs to be managed. The vaccination programme continues, and we need to meet the needs of people who require hospital care for COVID-19 and those with longer term symptoms following COVID-19 infection. We must also remain prepared for further peaks as the pandemic runs its course. This includes plans to manage and increase capacity to respond to demand that may be fuelled by further waves of COVID-19 and/or severe outbreaks of respiratory and other illness over the winter months. This business plan sets out NHS England\u2019s work in leading and supporting the NHS to respond to these challenges as well as the opportunities to transform the delivery of care and health outcomes through collaborative system working, and the use of data and digital technologies. This plan doesn\u2019t describe everything we will do, but highlights our key commitments for 2022/23 under ten headings that reflect the main themes of our mandate from government: Support the NHS to attract and retain more people, working differently in a compassionate and inclusive culture. Continue to lead the NHS in responding to COVID-19 ever more effectively. Deliver more elective care to tackle the elective backlog, reduce long waits and improve performance against cancer waiting times standards. Improve the responsiveness of urgent and emergency care and increase its capacity. Improve access to primary care. Improve mental health services and services for people with a learning disability and/or autistic people. Deliver improvements in maternity care. Prevent ill health and tackle health inequalities. Drive the integration of care and enable change. Improve productivity and reduce variation across the health system. Amanda Pritchard , NHS Chief Executive.

GP staff can view and download records to fulfil access requests Scanning providers Lloyd George records are scanned and uploaded into the National Document Repository: Access and store digital patient documents service. GP staff can view and download records to fulfil access requests Lloyd George records are historical paper-based records for GP patients that were used across the United Kingdom before GP records were digitised. Many older patients still have Lloyd George records that contain information that was recorded prior to digitisation. Some GP practices have local solutions for scanning and digitising Lloyd George records. Others still have the original paper records. For further context see Digitisation of Lloyd George records . The National Document Repository The National Document Repository (NDR) is a central place where digital patient documents can be accessed and stored by frontline services. 'Access and store digital patient documents' is the first service available within the NDR. It allows GP practices to access, view and download digital Lloyd George records. The Patient Record Management (PRM) team are responsible for delivering this service. It is our intention that the NDR will support other use cases such as: digitised Lloyd George records for the Ministry of Defence digitised Lloyd George records for the Ministry of Justice Access Request Fulfilment (ARF) - making records available to NHS England digital fall-back for GP2GP failures digital fall-back for \u2018late letters\u2019 cross border paperless GP record transfers Who this service is for We are currently rolling out the service to GP practices in the Birmingham and Solihull (BSOL) area. You can use this service if your practice is within the BSOL area and you need to view or download a patient record. If you are a practice outside of BSOL and a patient registers with you from a practice involved in the roll out, you can use this service to access and store their digital Lloyd George record. Eventually, the service will be available to all GP practices in England. What information is available The service contains scanned and digitised Lloyd George records that have been uploaded by participating GP practices, or by their partner scanning suppliers. In most cases, Lloyd George records only exist for older patients, but they can also exist for younger patients - this can happen if a patient moves practices and their records aren't transferred digitally for some reason. For more details on which patients might have Lloyd George records, see Digitisation of Lloyd George records . National usage policy This service is currently being rolled out to the Birmingham and Solihull ICB. It will eventually be strongly recommended for all GP practices in England. Examples of use Examples of use include: a clinician accessing a patient's digital Lloyd George record to support clinical decision making a GP administrator accessing a patient's digital Lloyd George record to fulfil an access request Benefits Benefits of the service include: easier access to patient records at registration reduces the likelihood of losing information from a paper record reduces the administrative burden for practices removes the need for physical storage space for paper records For more details, see Benefits of Lloyd George digitisation to patients and practices . How this service works For the initial roll out, the service works like this: 1. Upload records Scanning suppliers work with GP practices to scan their Lloyd George records and upload them to our service via secure file transfer protocol (SFTP). 2. Access records Healthcare workers, including clinicians and GP administrators, can: Sign in to the service's user interface, using their NHS smartcard or other CIS2 authentication method Search for a patient using their NHS number View the patient's Lloyd George record, if it exists. Download a copy of the record. Status, current usage and service level This service is in beta . We are rolling out the service to GP practices in the Birmingham and Solihull (BSOL) area. This is a bronze service , meaning it is available and supported during business hours 8am to 6pm Monday to Friday but not bank holidays. Roadmap There is a phased programme of roll out for this service. Phase 1: Pilot participant (complete) We tested the ability to store and access patient Lloyd George records with a partner practice in Birmingham. Phase 2: Roll out to Birmingham and Solihull Integrated Care Board (ICB) We are currently testing the ability to store and access patient Lloyd George records with a wider roll out within the BSOL ICB. Phase 3: National roll out The service will be made available to all GP practices in England. Paper records will be digitised upon transfer. Phase 4: Further integration with NHS England's National Record Locator API Upon completion, approved and authenticated users will be able to locate and access patient records. Phase 5: Expand the use cases of the National Document Repository We plan to broaden the scope of the repository to include other use cases.

Page contents 16 July 2025 What we\u2019ve changed We\u2019ve made some performance and security improvements in this release. You won\u2019t notice any changes to how the service looks or works. Release 1.5.19 7 July 2025 What's new There\u2019s been an update to gov.uk design components. These are design elements that government websites use to provide a consistent look and feel to their services. This service uses some of these components, so you may notice they look different now. The warning shown before you remove a record now looks like the screen image below. What we\u2019ve changed Improvements to the file transfer process We\u2019ve improved the process of transferring files into the National Document Repository from multiple suppliers so that we reduce the risk of duplicate files. Files will be grouped by both NHS number and ODS code in the queue for transfer into the service. When a metadata file contains an NHS number that is shared across two or more ODS codes, the first grouped NHS number will be transferred into the service and the second one onwards will be rejected. A message saying \u2018Lloyd George already exists\u2019 will be added to the report for the any rejected file. Security improvements We have made further security improvements to our API gateway. Release 1.5.18 18 June 2025 What's new When a practice\u2019s records are transferred into the service, we can now share with the practice the percentage of files that have transferred successfully. What we\u2019ve changed We\u2019ve made technical changes so that it\u2019s quicker to download a patient\u2019s Lloyd George record. We\u2019ve made accessibility improvements for Primary Care Support England (PCSE) screen reader users. Screen readers will now announce to PCSE users the status of a download. We\u2019ve changed how we identify NHS numbers and match them to the Personal Demographics Service (PDS) when records are transferred into the service. These changes will help us to resolve record rejections quicker. What we\u2019ve fixed We\u2019ve fixed a bug that meant some users were unable to view and download patient Lloyd George records. Release 1.5.17 4 June 2025 What\u2019s new You can now view Lloyd George records in the \u2018Available records\u2019 page using a new toolbar. This toolbar allows you to: search for keywords within a record rotate a record zoom in and out of a record print a record (for example, if you need to provide a print copy to another organisation for legal or insurance reasons) What we\u2019ve changed The code which controls how NHS websites look and work has been updated. We are now using the updated code in this service. The update has changed the button style so you may notice they look different. Release 1.5.16 21 May 2025 What\u2019s new We\u2019ve made a change that enables selected healthcare providers to access the National Document Repository. These providers have registered patients but are not classified as GP practices in the Organisation Data Set (ODS). Access to Lloyd George records will help these providers deliver better patient care. Release 1.5.15 7 May 2025 What we\u2019ve fixed In some areas of the service, text wasn't resizing correctly when you zoom in using the browser. We've fixed this issue so you can now zoom in and the text will resize correctly. This will help users who need to use the zoom function to read all content throughout our service. Release 1.5.14 23 April 2025 What we've changed This release contains bug fixes and accessibility improvements: users were unable to download records if more than one record existed - this has now been fixed accessibility improvements have been made to improve the user experience Release 1.5.13 9 April 2025 What we\u2019ve changed You will now be able to view the Lloyd George record in full screen. This view uses more of the screen space and allows you to view record in more detail by zooming and in out: Release 1.5.12 26 March 2025 What we\u2019ve changed You will now see a session timeout message if your session expires whilst you are in the \u2018Download a report\u2019 section of the service. This will make it easier to understand the problem and sign back in to continue your work. Access to the records of deceased patients GP practices and Primary Care Support England (PCSE) can now view the Lloyd George record of a deceased patient within the service. To view the record of a deceased patient: Enter the NHS number of a deceased patient in the \u2018Search for a patient\u2019 page. You will be asked to give a reason why you need access to the record. Select all reasons that are relevant to your case and click to continue. You will then be able to view the record.

This report contains: the number of Lloyd George records stored for your organisation in this service a list of the NHS numbers for the Lloyd George records stored for your organisation in this service You can access the page to download the report from our new home pag. What we\u2019ve changed We've changed: the order of the information on the \u2018Privacy notice\u2019 page to make this information easier to understand the logo and the service name within the service header so that they are accessible using keyboard controls some error messages to make them clearer and more specific so that it's easier to understand the problem Coming soon Access to deceased patient records Currently, practices do not have access to the digital Lloyd George records of deceased patients in this service because these records do not have an ODS code. We are working on a new part of the service which will give practices access to the Lloyd George records of deceased patients. Release 1.5.10 26 February 2025 What\u2019s new You can now view a patient record to the maximum width of your screen. This will make it easier for you to view and read the record. Our new feedback survey is ready for you to complete. You can access this through the link in the feedback form found within the service (see the image below). We welcome any comments or suggestions you have about the service through this survey. What we\u2019ve changed When records are initially transferred to the service, we carry out validation checks against the Patient Demographics Service to make sure we are transferring the right Lloyd George record for the right patient. We have improved these validation checks, which means we can move more records into the service. This means there will be less work for practices to resolve validation errors. We\u2019ve made improvements to backend of the service in preparation for the annual security review. These changes will ensure we are meeting cyber security standards and providing a secure service for our users. Release version 1.5.9 29 January 2025 This release includes changes to the content and design of some of our service pages to improve the user experience and accessibility. What we\u2019ve changed Change to heading levels on the Privacy notice page We have changed the heading level labels on the Privacy notice page.

This is so that you will know how much storage space on your computer a record will use if you choose to download it. New wording for cancel link on the download page We have changed the wording of the cancel link on the download screen from \u2018Cancel\u2019 to \u2018Cancel and return to patient record\u2019.

This link will now take you back to Patient details page, even after you have downloaded a record. This should make this section of the service easier to navigate. We have removed information about the number of files, file size and file format from the Available records page because this information was not needed here. This information will be given on the Download page in a future release. Changes to the \u2018Verify patient details\u2019 page We have renamed the \u2018Verify patient details\u2019 page to \u2018Patient details\u2019 and updated the content and design of this page to improve user understanding and accessibility.

      "content": "Acute Data Alignment Programme (ADAPt) The Acute Data Alignment Programme (ADAPt) is a joint programme between NHS Digital and the Private Healthcare Information Network (PHIN) which is looking to adopt common standards for data collections and performance measures across both the NHS and private healthcare. This will ensure that relevant information is consistently recorded and available so it can be more easily analysed and compared. Page contents About ADAPt The aim of ADAPt is to move towards a common set of standards for data collections, performance measure methodologies and reporting systems across NHS and private healthcare. Where care has been received privately, the quality of that care will become more visible and patient records more complete. The purpose is to protect patient safety through appropriate, secure and robust information sharing \u2013 ensuring the right information is available to the right people, in the right place at the right time. The programme is being jointly led by the Private Healthcare Information Network (PHIN) and NHS Digital, in partnership with the Department of Health and Social care (DHSC), NHS Improvement (NHSI), NHS England (NHSE), the Care Quality Commission (CQC) and other bodies. The aims of ADAPt To make it easier to monitor the quality and safety of services by including private healthcare data within healthcare reporting systems. To help staff keep accurate and complete records when a patient journey spans both private and public providers. To ensure transparency for patients by publishing comparable performance measures relating to quality of care and patient safety for both privately funded and NHS funded healthcare. To identify where the burden of data collection and reporting by NHS and private care providers can be reduced. Programme governance The programme has a governance board comprising membership from important stakeholders, including: NHS Digital (co-chair) The Private Healthcare Information Network (co-chair) Department of Health and Social Care Care Quality Commission NHS England / NHS Improvement NHS Resolution Independent Healthcare Providers Network (observers only) ADAPt will be delivered in three main phases Phase 1: Co-operation (ending March 2020) This phase of the project has three sub workstreams: To publish performance measures for private healthcare, as required by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) Private Healthcare Market Investigation Order 2014 (as amended 2017, \u201cthe CMA Order\u201d). Investigate the current state of private healthcare data and the challenges ahead. PHIN and the CMA have already attempted to align to NHS England data standards wherever possible.

To explore how the programme could co-operate, and encourage the use of common standards for NHS and private healthcare across other national programmes and initiatives such as Getting It Right First Time (GIRFT). Phase 2: Alignment of data flow, processing and analysis (ending March 2022) ADAPt ran a public consultation exercise from 19 February 2020 to 22 May 2020 on the NHS Digital consultation hub , seeking feedback on proposals to change the way in which private healthcare data is collected, processed, reported and disseminated. It specifically proposed that information about private healthcare Admitted Patient Care (APC) activity be reported to NHS Digital alongside information about NHS funded patients, using common data standards. The consultation proposed three pilots: 1. Piloting the flow of private healthcare APC data from the Private Healthcare Information Network (PHIN) to NHS Digital. 2. Piloting the flow of private healthcare APC data collected from NHS Private Patient Units (PPUs) by NHS Digital to PHIN. 3. Piloting the supply to PHIN of private APC data from independent providers to NHS Digital. Participants included providers, clinicians and members of the public. Thirty responses from across the stakeholder spectrum, including private providers, NHS PPU, national bodies, professional bodies and representative organisations were received. The vision for a standardised single source of healthcare information, with common standards across the two sectors was widely endorsed. The General Medical Council noted their support for consultation, stating: We support the intention to establish common standards to record and report activity relating to patient outcomes consistently across both the NHS and private sector. We agree that this should make a positive contribution to strengthening healthcare governance and reducing patient safety risks. You can view a copy of the consultation report .

The programme, first conceived by the then Secretary of State for Health, Jeremy Hunt, set out to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of making private Admitted Patient Care (APC) data available to NHS systems. Find out more about the programme . Pilots carried out during 2022 demonstrated both the benefits of such flows, through a series of customer use cases, as well as the lack of technical barriers preventing private hospitals submitting their data directly to NHS Digital (via Secondary Uses Services (SUS)). The pilots also confirmed that PHIN could continue to meet its statutory duties using a single supply of private data from NHS Digital rather than via the multiple supplies it currently receives directly from private providers. The report makes several recommendations, including establishing a permanent flow of APC data into NHS Digital by autumn 2023. The first stage of this work (Phase 3 of the programme) will start with a public consultation, taking place early in 2023.

This will ensure that relevant information is consistently recorded and available so it can be more easily analysed and compared. Page contents About ADAPt The aim of ADAPt is to move towards a common set of standards for data collections, performance measure methodologies and reporting systems across NHS and private healthcare. Where care has been received privately, the quality of that care will become more visible and patient records more complete. The purpose is to protect patient safety through appropriate, secure and robust information sharing \u2013 ensuring the right information is available to the right people, in the right place at the right time. The programme is being jointly led by the Private Healthcare Information Network (PHIN) and NHS Digital, in partnership with the Department of Health and Social care (DHSC), NHS Improvement (NHSI), NHS England (NHSE), the Care Quality Commission (CQC) and other bodies. The aims of ADAPt To make it easier to monitor the quality and safety of services by including private healthcare data within healthcare reporting systems. To help staff keep accurate and complete records when a patient journey spans both private and public providers. To ensure transparency for patients by publishing comparable performance measures relating to quality of care and patient safety for both privately funded and NHS funded healthcare. To identify where the burden of data collection and reporting by NHS and private care providers can be reduced.

Page contents COVID-19 impact on services The COVID-19 outbreak has affected the delivery of the NBO tracing service. Regretfully, this means that the death registration enquiries services ha s been suspended until further notice . Any service requests received will be returned unprocessed. How to use this service To use this service you must make an application through either: social services the adoption team at your local council a registered charity a registered adoption agency a registered adoption support service You will need to include the organisation's ofsted, charity or registration number in the application. We do not accept applications from individuals. Information required in an application The organisation acting on your behalf needs to provide the following information about the birth relative or adopted child: Full post-adoptive names, copy of original birth certificate if available, date of birth or approximate age if known, and adoptee's address if known. Full names, date of birth or approximate age if known, and birth relative's address if known. When searching for a birth father, confirmation that he is named as the father on the original birth certificate, or in the adoption papers. If we find a record of an England, Wales or Isle of Man Civil Death Registration, we can give you advice about how to get a copy of the Civil Death Registration. This information will be provided only if the name under which the death is registered, is the name quoted by the applicant. When a death registration cannot be identified Finding no trace of a death registration usually means the person has not died. However, where an individual has died outside of England, Wales or the Isle of Man (overseas), it is unlikely NHS Digital will be aware that the death has occurred. There are occasions when an individual has died in England, Wales or the Isle of Man, but the NHS Digital record has not been marked as deceased. Such occasions are rare, less than 0.5% of the total deaths registered in England, Wales and the Isle of Man are not matched to NHS Digital records. Why some NHS Digital records are not marked as deceased when an individual has died The details provided on the Civil Death Registration are provided by an 'informant'. Depending on how well the informant knew the deceased, there may be name or date of birth discrepancies between details provided for the purpose of registering the death, and details recorded for the purpose of the administration of the NHS, which prevent the Civil Death Registration from being matched with the deceased's NHS record.

Where the relative can be found, they will be informed by their doctor about the possibility of having a hereditary condition, and given advice on what to do. Page contents Who this service is for When a patient is diagnosed with a medical condition which is hereditary (so passed from parents to children), there is a chance that their relatives also have the condition. Where the patient is not in contact with their birth relatives, due to adoption or other reasons, this service will confidentially inform the doctor of their relative(s), who will then contact them to discuss the condition, what it might mean for them, and arrange any appropriate tests or care. This is done through professional contact, and does not allow for contact between the applicant and their relatives. Information that can be passed on The service can only be used when agreed with the doctors of both parties. Only information relating to an existing hereditary condition can be passed on. Using the service The service is normally requested by the person who has been diagnosed with a hereditary medical condition, or their doctor. Applications must include a signed letter from the doctor of the person diagnosed, which: does not include any personal information about either their patient, or the person being looked for has the relevant information about the medical condition has the doctor's name, address, postcode, and General Medical Council code The application must also give as much information as possible about the relative(s) being looked for. This must be separate to the signed letter, or the application will be rejected. It will be easier to find the right person when more information is provided. Relevant identifying details can include: full names, including their name after any adoption date of birth where known, or approximate age a copy of any birth or adoption certificates Where to send the application Applications should be sent by post to: Adoption registration service NHS Digital Smedley Hydro Room B108 Trafalgar Road Southport PR8 2HH Last edited: 7 May 2019 9:59 am",

Depending on the answers they give, this could mean they are seen in A&E, or are directed or referred to other urgent care services in the area. The service has been commissioned as part of the 111 First initiative, which encourages everyone with an urgent health concern to visit 111.nhs.uk or call 111 to find out the best place to get help. This will involve getting a booked arrival time if appropriate, which will help reduce unnecessary attendances at A&E during the coronavirus outbreak and enable social distancing.

      "content": "API platform The NHS Digital API platform is a \u2018front door\u2019 for health and care APIs, primarily for the NHS in England. Page contents Overview The NHS Digital API platform is a \u2018front door\u2019 for health and care APIs, primarily for the NHS in England. APIs are used by point-of-care applications and patient-facing applications to talk to back-end applications. Most of the back-end applications are owned by NHS Digital, but some are owned by third parties. The platform provides a consistent experience for API consumers and API producers that makes integration easier and supports NHS England's Open API policy . Components The API platform has three components: the API gateway the developer hub (including digital onboarding) the API producer zone API Gateway The API gateway is the runtime component of the API platform, and includes: API proxies \u2013 the front door for each API, handling security and rate limiting an authorisation server \u2013 this authenticates and authorises the calling application and end user, and is integrated with NHS Care Identity Service 2 and NHS login logging, monitoring and alerting \u2013 tools to keep the platform healthy Developer hub (including digital onboarding) The developer hub is for API consumers - people building front-end applications that consume APIs. It's not just for programmers and architects \u2013 it's also for product owners, business analysts, delivery leads, testers, CTOs and entrepreneurs. It includes: getting started information, including tutorials a searchable API catalogue detailed API specifications self-service access to test environments a digital onboarding service for access to production help and support Some of the features require you to create an NHS Digital developer account. API producer zone The API producer zone (account required) is for API producers - people building back-end applications that expose APIs, including: technical and non-technical people NHS Digital and third party people It includes: self-service API producer guidance, both technical and process technical support non-technical support lightweight governance - to ensure APIs are built to a consistent quality Currently, you need an NHS Digital Confluence account to access the API producer zone. To get access, see getting started . Service level The API platform is a platinum service, meaning: it is available and supported 24 x 7 x 365 it has a guaranteed availability of 99.9%, although actual availability is much higher - for example in 2021 it was 99.995% Benefits The API platform is part of our mission to make integration easier , and provides benefits for both API consumers and API producers. It has been described as \u2018exemplary\u2019 by the Government Digital Service . Benefits for API consumers For API consumers, the API platform provides: a consistent, modern experience using open standards such as REST , FHIR and OAuth 2.0 self-service and immediate access to test environments quicker and easier access to production using our digital onboarding service access from the internet, as well as HSCN documentation that is clear, consistent and comprehensive, using OAS for API specifications a single point of contact for help and support when you\u2019re stuck In surveys, 100% of API consumers have rated the API platform as either \u2018easy\u2019 or \u2018very easy\u2019 to use overall (as of February 2022). Benefits for API producers For API producers, the API platform provides: quicker and more predictable delivery using our easy-to-follow API delivery process get started quickly using our one-click API platform set-up tool full customisation, with plug-and-play modules for authorisation, rate limiting, logging, monitoring and alerting a full CI/CD pipeline, including multiple path-to-live environments quick and easy API documentation using OAS (aka swagger) comprehensive self-service technical and non-technical guidance in our API producer zone (account required) dedicated technical and non-technical support for when you\u2019re stuck One API producer said they were 'frankly astonished' at how quickly they were able to set up their API on our platform. Benefits to the wider NHS By making integration easier , we provide a number of benefits to the wider NHS: API producers and consumers can get useful, integrated software to market quicker and cheaper ...which gives them more time to add and improve features the lower barrier to entry allows more software providers into the marketplace ...which creates an environment for digital innovation to thrive ...and pushes down software costs to the NHS healthcare workers and patients have a wider variety of well-integrated software to choose from ...which means they are more likely to have the information they need, when and where they need it History and status The API platform was launched in 2020, as part of our mission to make integration easier . It exited beta in March 2022, apart from the developer account, which is still in beta. The first API we built on the platform was the Personal Demographics Service FHIR API . This is our 'exemplar' API \u2013 a demonstration of what good looks like. Since then, all new NHS Digital APIs have been built on the platform, and we have been working to migrate our existing APIs to the platform. This is likely to take some time. You can check on our progress by viewing our API catalogue, filtered on API platform APIs . You can see what\u2019s in the pipeline by viewing our interactive product backlog . This includes upcoming APIs as well as API platform features. Case studies We only have one case study at present: How NHS Digital used API Management to support APIs at scale - this talks about the delivery of the PDS FHIR API More case studies to follow. Technology stack and open source Our API platform has a hybrid technology stack, using a blend of proprietary products, open source products and bespoke code. Specifically, at the time of writing (27 April 2022), we are using: Google Apigee Edge as our core API platform tool - which is hosted in the cloud on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Amazon Web Services (AWS) as our hosting solution for custom components - which are generally written in Python and deployed as Docker containers on Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) Microsoft Azure Pipelines for our deployment pipelines KeyCloak as our developer identity provider GitHub to host our source code LocalStack for local testing Terraform for infrastructure management Splunk , Grafana and Prometheus for logging monitoring and alerting FeatureUpvote for our interactive product backlog Our bespoke code, including the code for all our API proxies, is mostly coded in the open and is hosted in our GitHub repositories . We welcome contributions from the developer community - but we're not always watching out for them, so if you do raise a pull request, you might want to contact us to let us know. Getting started API consumers To get started as an API consumer, see the developer hub . API producers You can use the NHS Digital API platform to expose APIs for: NHS Digital back-end applications third party back-end applications You can use it to: publish your API documentation provide a technical 'front door' for your API provide digital onboarding for your API or other service You don't have to do all three - for example you might want to just publish your API documentation, or just use digital onboarding. You can only use the API platform for APIs or services that support the delivery of health and care for the NHS in England - although there are some exceptions to this rule. We operate a 'platform' model - you build and run your own API, using our tools and with our help and support. The API platform is centrally funded - it's free of charge for NHS Digital and third party API producers. This is subject to a reasonable use policy, and also might change in the future. To get started as an API producer, see our API producer zone . Currently, you need an NHS Digital Confluence account to access the API producer zone. To get access, contact us . In the meantime, you can download: our API Producer Overview slide deck a snapshot of the API producer zone as a PDF file - taken on 29 April 2022 and with some sensitive information removed Downloads These are a PowerPoint file and a Portable Document Format file.

Page contents About this service The NHS England API platform is a centralised hub for health and care APIs, designed to streamline integration for point-of-care and patient-facing applications. The platform provides tools, tutorials, and self-service access to support efficient API development, whilst providing a secure gateway to NHS systems. It simplifies integration whilst ensuring compliance with information governance and NHS policies. For API Producer teams, the platform fosters digital innovation, reduces software costs, and accelerates market readiness, aligning with NHS England\u2019s Data Saves Lives and Open API policies to deliver consistent, high-quality API experiences for developers and organisations. Benefits The API platform is part of our mission to make integration easier , and provides benefits for both API consumers and API producers. Benefits for API consumers For API consumers, the API platform provides: a consistent, modern experience using open standards such as REST , FHIR and OAuth 2.0 self-service and immediate access to test environments quicker and easier access to production using our digital onboarding service access from the internet, as well as HSCN documentation that is clear, consistent and comprehensive, using OAS for API specifications a single point of contact for help and support Benefits for API producers For API producers, the API platform provides: quicker and more predictable delivery using our easy-to-follow API delivery process get started quickly using our one-click API platform set-up tool full customisation, with plug-and-play modules for authorisation, rate limiting, logging, monitoring and alerting a full CI/CD pipeline, including multiple path-to-live environments quick and easy API documentation using OAS comprehensive self-service technical and non-technical guidance in our API producer zone (account required) dedicated technical and non-technical support a free proxy generating API (Proxygen) that allows producers to build proxies within hours rather than weeks Benefits to the wider NHS By making integration easier , we provide a number of benefits to the wider NHS: API producers and consumers can get useful integrated software deployed quicker and cheaper, meaning there's more time to add and improve features the lower barrier to entry allows more software providers into the marketplace, creating an environment for digital innovation to thrive whilst pushing down software costs to the NHS healthcare workers and patients have a wider variety of well-integrated software to choose from, meaning they are more likely to have the information they need, when and where they need it Who the service is for The API platform is for API consumers and API producers, primarily for use by the NHS in England. National usage policy You can only use the API platform for APIs or services that support the delivery of health and care for the NHS in England, although there are some exceptions to this rule. We operate a 'platform' model where you build and run your own API, using our tools with our help and support. How this service works Our API platform has a hybrid technology stack, using a blend of proprietary products, open source and bespoke code. Specifically, at the time of writing (January 2025), we are using: Google Apigee Edge as our core API platform tool - which is hosted in the cloud on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Amazon Web Services (AWS) as our hosting solution for custom components - which are generally written in Python or .NET C# and deployed as Docker containers on Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) Microsoft Azure Pipelines for our deployment pipelines KeyCloak as our developer identity provider GitHub to host our source code LocalStack for local testing Terraform for infrastructure management Splunk , Grafana and Prometheus for logging monitoring and alerting FeatureUpvote for our interactive product backlog Discourse for our developer community forum Our bespoke code, including the code for all our API proxies, is mostly coded in the open and is hosted in our GitHub repositories . We welcome contributions from the developer community - but we're not always watching out for them, so if you do raise a pull request, you might want to contact us to let us know. API consumers To get started as an API consumer, see the developer and integration hub . API producers To get started as an API producer, see Building healthcare APIs . Status, service level and current usage The API platform is live and is a platinum service , meaning: it is available and supported 24 x 7 x 365 it has a guaranteed availability of 99.9%, although actual availability is higher - for example in 2021 it was 99.995% The API platform was launched in 2020, as part of our mission to make integration easier and exited beta in March 2022. The first API we built on the platform was the Personal Demographics Service FHIR API . This is our 'exemplar' API \u2013 a demonstration of what good looks like. Since then, all new NHS England APIs have been built on the platform, and we have been working to migrate our existing APIs to the platform. This is likely to take some time. You can check on our progress by viewing our API and integration catalogue, filtered on API platform APIs . You can see what\u2019s in the pipeline by viewing our interactive product backlog . This includes upcoming APIs as well as API platform features. Roadmap At the time of writing, December 2024, timelines are currently being agreed, but some high level roadmap items are: migration from Apigee Edge to Apigee X further iterative Proxygen enhancements AI tooling through the Google API Hub Examples of use For details of case studies, see Case studies .

Page contents Overview This page explains what\u2019s involved in building healthcare APIs for the NHS in England, and how our API platform can help. It applies to anyone who is thinking of building a healthcare API with national applicability \u2013 whether for NHS England or for a third party. Building a good API There is more to building a good API than you might think - hands-on coding is only around 20% of the work. Other tasks include: writing API documentation setting up test environments and test data designing and running the \u2018onboarding\u2019 process for API consumers providing help and support to API consumers marketing your API and getting people to use it Over the years we\u2019ve gathered a lot of feedback on what a good API looks like, primarily from people who are actually building healthcare software. We\u2019ve incorporated the key points into our API policies and best practice . These policies are mandatory for NHS England and strongly recommended for everyone else. API platform Our API platform makes building APIs easier, and provides many of the features you need to build a good API, including: a cloud-based hosting platform for your API, with plug-and-play security, rate limiting, logging, monitoring and alerting an API catalogue where you can publish your API specification extensive documentation for API producers, including a step-by-step API delivery process technical and non-technical support for API producers, including extensive documentation and a step-by-step delivery process self-service access to test environments for API consumers a digital onboarding tool for API consumer onboarding first line support and a developer community forum for API consumers You can use our API platform to expose APIs for: NHS England back-end applications third party back-end applications The API platform is mandatory for NHS England APIs and strongly recommended for third party APIs. You can only use the API platform for APIs or services that support the delivery of health and care for the NHS in England - although there are some exceptions to this rule. We operate a 'platform' model - you build and run your own API, using our tools and with our help and support. The API platform is centrally funded - it's free of charge for NHS England and third party API producers. This is subject to a reasonable use policy, and also might change in the future. Use of the API platform, including third party use, is underpinned by our legal directions . API delivery process Our API delivery process includes all the steps needed to build and run a good API. Inception Discovery Alpha 1. Establish a dedicated team 2. Engage with NHSE API 3. Signup on NHSE developer portal 4. Decide scope 5. Secure funding 6. Build a team 7. Create initial API prototype and validate API design Beta 8. Iterate on alpha feedback 9. Pilot the API 10. Prepare self-serve documentation Live 11. Publicly deploy the API 12. Promote and encourage adoption 13. Incorporate user feedback Sunsetting 14. Communicate API deprecation 15. Decommission API End-to-end API delivery process Our process is based on the GOV.UK agile delivery process , but with an API focus. ARTICLE API delivery process A summary of the phases and key steps to deliver a healthcare API for the NHS in England. Getting started For detailed guidance on building healthcare APIs, see our API producer zone . To use many of NHS England's systems, developers will need NHS shortcodes and an HSCIC email address . You will also need an nhs.net address to get access to Confluence .

      "content": "Developer integration survey - January 2023 Every year since we started the API Management programme (except for 2022) we have conducted an annual survey. Here are the results for January 2023. Page contents Overview We\u2019re on a mission to make integration easier . Every year since we started the API Management programme (except for 2022) we have conducted an annual survey to get your views and thought it would be a good idea to share the results with you. This page contains the results of the survey from January 2023. Approach We ask you to rate us on a 1-to-5-point scale, on several different areas plus an overall rating. Then we take the average. We also ask you to explain your answers. This year\u2019s survey You're working across the software development industry, as software developers, architects, delivery managers, product owners, CTO/CIOs and so on. Most of you are from larger (100+ people) companies but with a mix of smaller sizes. The majority of companies are in commercial software development, and you\u2019re creating a broad range of software, from patient-facing applications to GP software. Despite the PDS FHIR API being the most popular API, you use a wide range of APIs. Some are on our new API platform , but many are older APIs which don\u2019t benefit from its new features. So, you gave us a mixed set of responses, not just for APIs based on our new API platform. Results The ratings we ask you for every year are: Learning \u2013 our documentation and tutorials. Design and build \u2013 the technical part of API integration. Testing \u2013 checking the quality of your API integration. Onboarding \u2013 getting clinical and technical approval to use an API. Help and support \u2013 from our mailbox (and new developer community). Overall rating - on how well you think we\u2019re doing in general. Learning We scored 3.67 - up from 3.1 and 2.1 in previous years. Positive comments Suggested improvements \u201ca breath of fresh air\u201d \u201cmultiple portals when a single one would be helpful\u201d \u201con par with what we find in private sector\u201d \u201ctoo many places to find documentation, it doesn\u2019t seem centralised\u201d \u201cwell laid out and explained\u201d (PDS FHIR API) \u201chard to see what has changed when FHIR APIs change\u201d Design and build We scored 3.74 - up from 3.1 and 2.4 in previous years. Comments were much fewer, leading us to think that the technology is not really the problem. Positive comments Suggested improvements \u201cgenerally good with useable code examples\u201d \u201cWe need to check for patient opt-out using MESH. It\u2019s old and tricky. We\u2019d like a nice new REST API.\u201d \u201cit\u2019s been quite easy since we have worked with FHIR before\u201d \u201cWasn\u2019t an example in our chosen language, Node\u201d \u201csince the move from spine mini service to the new REST API the integration has been relatively easier\u201d \u201cDependence on JWT complicated integration\u201d Testing We scored 3.6 - up from 3.0 and 2.3 in previous years. Positive comments Suggested improvements \u201cgood testing experience\u201d \u201cit would be good if the available test data sets were made more easily accessible\u201d \u201chaving integration environment APIs is great\u201d \u201cthe call rate limit makes it really hard to test\u201d \u201cincluded Postman collection is perfect\u201d \u201cvery difficult when not all environments are set up the same and (test) patients differ between systems\u201d Onboarding This is a mixed score covering our new digital onboarding process, the spreadsheet-based SCAL process, and older onboarding processes. Looking at the digital onboarding score alone, the score jumps to 3.85 showing our new online process is definitely improving customer satisfaction! Positive comments Suggested improvements \u201cdigital onboarding is much easier and allows you to make progress in stages\u201d \u201cit would be very helpful to understand the requirements prior to the formal onboarding process\u201d \u201cdigital onboarding is a HUGE improvement from the Excel documents\u201d \u201ca bit too much silos between teams/departments within NHS\u201d \u201ckudos to the onboarding platform team \u2013 transformative\" \u201cplease kill the SCAL spreadsheet\u201d Help and support This has always been our strongest score, traditionally reflecting the work we put into our dedicated API support mailbox. But it also reflects the recent introduction of our new developer community - where developers can help each other, as well as get answers from us. Positive comments Suggested improvements \u201cNHS API people tend to be friendly and helpful\u201d \u201cVariable again. CIS2 onboarding excellent due to dedicated support team and regular meetings, MESH and PDS is still ongoing but the support does not appear as freely available.\u201d \u201cthe new dev community will be a welcome addition\u201d \u201ca simple video reply would be great\u201d \u201cAwesome!!! You guys are great!! I just think you could be even more self-service.\u201d \u201cMS Teams can be problematic\u201d Overall score We scored 3.78 - up from 3.0 and 2.3 in previous years. Again, this is a mixed score, but if we look at the exit surveys this year for the PDS FHIR API, which uses our APIM platform and digital onboarding, the overall score jumps to 4.1 which is actually above the 4.0 target score we set ourselves back in 2020! Conclusions and next steps We\u2019re delighted to see you think we\u2019ve continuously improved across all areas. If we can make all our APIs as easy to use as the PDS FHIR API, and apply digital onboarding to all our APIs, then we should hit our target score for the whole API estate. All of which we\u2019re doing as fast as we can, but there\u2019s still a lot to do! Meanwhile, we continue to focus on helping our API producers understand what a good API looks like, through API design and documentation reviews. We also publish our API policies and best practice based on what works best for our API consumers. What we are we doing with the survey results As a result of the survey, our product owners got together to examine your feedback in detail and revise our roadmap accordingly. From the survey, the improvements that we\u2019ve moved up the priority list are: supplying consistent test data across more APIs than currently providing API onboarding requirements up front before the onboarding process clarifying dependencies between APIs where access to one also requires access to others including Node coding examples making our internal patient data opt-out REST API externally facing In addition, we recognise that onboarding is our weakest area, and that is a focus for improvements by moving more existing services to use digital onboarding. Many thanks for your survey responses \u2013 they really do help with setting our priorities. Remember, you can always suggest, comment or vote on features using our interactive product backlog .

      "title": "Artificial data pilot - NHS Digital",
      "content": "Artificial data pilot Artificial data sets provide users with large volumes of data that share some of the characteristics of real data while protecting patient confidentiality. They are designed to model the structure of real data but are completely artificial \u2013 they do not contain any actual patient records. We are piloting this new service with a limited number of artificial data sets. Page contents About the pilot We hold over 200 healthcare data sets. These data sets are fundamental for analysis and research to accelerate the discovery of new treatments and helping the NHS to plan better services. Since patient data is sensitive, only approved users, with approved projects, are allowed to access and analyse data. As such, applying for access can be a lengthy process. Prior to receiving access, it can be difficult for prospective data users to know what: fields are present the data looks like data sets are available We are piloting this new service to help users understand the columns, data types and approximate value ranges that would appear in real data. Whilst our data sets can be used to improve understanding of data sets and data platforms, and for building and testing data pipelines, they cannot be used to analyse data. They can be used in advance or, for certain use cases, instead of real data which is only approved to requestors where there is an appropriate legal basis. This reduces bottlenecks for new users of data and data platforms and minimises the amount of personal data being processed for specific tasks. This artificial data represents the formatting, structure and volume of the original data set. It does not preserve relationships between fields and it is not possible to use artificial data to reidentify individuals. During this pilot we hope to understand how artificial data can be valuable to our users, identify other datasets for which it would be useful to provide artificial extracts, and gather further feedback on how to enhance the service . Anticipated benefits We have summarised the anticipated benefits of the pilot below: Users can collaborate and share code across different environments where real data is not accessible minimising the risk to patient privacy Using artificial data minimises the use of real data during development and testing work Users can develop and test code prior to accessing real data Artificial data can be used for teaching purposes to train the next generation of data engineers, scientists and clinicians Access artificial data sets There are currently 3 artificial data sets available from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) . All artificial data is generated entirely from anonymous, non-identifiable aggregated data. What is the difference between a sample and a full data set? A sample data set contains 10,000 rows and a full data set contains a million rows. Artificial HES A&E sample zip Artificial HES A&E sample (24.3MB) Artificial HES A&E full zip Artificial HES A&E full (2.4GB) Artificial HES Admitted Patient Care sample zip Artificial HES Admitted Patient Care sample (43.9MB) Artificial HES Admitted Patient Care full zip Artificial HES Admitted Patient Care full (4.3GB) Artificial HES Outpatient sample zip Artificial HES Outpatient sample (28.5MB) Artificial HES Outpatient full zip Artificial HES Outpatient full (2.8GB) Artificial data generator Explore the code used to generate this artificial data . This codebase could be adopted to generate your own artificial data. Artificial data generated by this method imitates some of the statistical properties of real data, but never contains any real patient data. Why this is safe to share Records in artificial data relate to fictitious patients, so do not constitute personal data under UK GDPR. There are 2 steps to generate artificial data: The \u2018metadata scraper\u2019 creates a national level, aggregated, anonymous summary of the real data. The \u2018data generator\u2019 randomly samples from the anonymous aggregates to generate artificial data. Between these 2 steps, the anonymous aggregates are reviewed and signed-off via a process agreed with our chief statistician and Statistical Disclosure Control Panel, in accordance with standard procedures for publishing statistics used across the organisation. Diagram: disclosure control process Image description This diagram shows how data generation is completely isolated from the aggregation, with a review and sign off process separating the 2 steps. Boxes on the left with a blue dashed border represent different scopes where real data is accessed. Within each scope, only a single data set is accessible and is completely isolated from other data sets. Data flows from left to right through the metadata scraper to produce anonymous aggregates for each data set. The red box to the right of centre represents the disclosure control process which has been agreed with our chief statistician and Statistical Disclosure Control Panel. Aggregate data is blocked from exiting the scope where it was created if the checks are not passed. Once all checks are passed, the data flows to the circle on the right of the image which represents the data generator. Finally, anonymous artificial data sets flow out of the data generator to be safely shared with users. The artificial data generator uses aggregate, anonymised data to randomly create artificial records. Statistical relationships between columns are not preserved, meaning that individual records are not an accurate representation of individual real records. Any attempt to reverse engineer the artificial data generator would only yield the aggregate statistics on which the artificial data is based. For example, each artificial record in a data set which contains records describing genders, ages, ICD 10 diagnoses, appointment dates and times, would be generated by randomly picking a value for each field independently and then putting these together to form a \u2018complete record\u2019. Most records generated in such a way would be unrealistic. For example, artificial patient records may have \u2018geriatrics\u2019 as the department being visited, and an age of 5 years old. Only by coincidence would some artificial records resemble real records. How the data is generated The artificial data generator randomly generates artificial data by sampling from anonymous univariate frequency distributions derived from real data. Diagram: Overview of process to generate artificial data Image description The diagram illustrates the main steps and outputs in creating the aggregates of real data and using them to generate artificial data. The diagram flows from top to bottom. The first box represents the original data set. Each column is aggregated independently by the metadata scraper in the second box (yellow). The third box shows the univariate frequency distributions created by the metadata scraper. Each field is completely independent, with no relationships are preserved in this aggregated data. The fourth box (red) represents the disclosure control process, which ensures that the aggregate data is non-identifiable. The fifth box (green) represents the step which generates the data. Anonymous aggregates flow into this process to independently generate fields in the artificial data. Post processing is applied to make the artificial records appear more realistic. Finally, the generated fields are combined to form \u2018complete records\u2019. Aggregation and anonymisation The original data is aggregated on a column-by-column basis, with each column treated independently. The outputs of this stage are frequency tables of unique values in each column. At this stage key identifiers (such as patient ID) are removed and small numbers are suppressed to prevent reidentification at a later stage. The aggregated data is anonymous, with each column aggregated independently of the others. For example, the aggregates could be used to approximately determine the number of female patients or the number of 49-year-old patients in the real data, but not the number of 49-year-old females. Random data generation The aggregated data is used to randomly generate artificial data. Each column, for each record, is generated at random. For example, artificial records assigned a relatively low age may have a geriatric diagnosis code. This lack of record level realism ensures the artificial data is anonymous so that it cannot be used to reidentify individuals. It also means that it would not be possible to gain insights or build statistical models that would transfer onto real data. Since the artificial data is generated using anonymised data, the artificial data itself is anonymous \u2013 it only contains as much information as the anonymous aggregate statistics from which it is derived. Post processing Once artificial data has been generated, some basic checks and rules are applied to make the data appear more realistic. For example, randomly generated birth and death dates may be swapped to ensure sensible ordering. Finally, randomly generated dummy values for identifying fields (such as \u2018patient\u2019 ID\u2019) are added. These fields are generated based on template patterns structured to ensure unrealistic values with the correct properties (for example, data type and length).

It will support GPs and other health and care professionals to take advantage of new systems and digital initiatives being developed across the health landscape which rely on the need for faster, more reliable broadband connectivity. There's a particular focus on removing inhibiting connectivity that is more common in rural areas. By continuing to improve broadband connectivity we will also enable a greater use of new digital services including remote consultations and virtual patient observation tools which require faster broadband speeds to run smoothly. These changes have the potential to reduce the need for patient travel and potentially a reduction of Did Not Attend (DNAs), as well as enabling speedier diagnosis. Project ADSL and Poor FFTC - Level-up Our first project, ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line) and FTTC (Fibre to the Cabinet) for Health, has been set up to address the issues presented by the poorest broadband connectivity within the NHS. In the short-term, whilst the majority of NHS premises already have superfast broadband (FTTC) connectivity or better, there remains a significant number of sites that are still reliant on ADSL or poor FTTC (less than 30Mbps) broadband connectivity, which is likely to prohibit the delivery of digital services. Funding opportunity for CCGs and Trusts to improve broadband connectivity We are: making support and funding available to NHS organisations, both CCGs and Trusts, whose broadband connectivity is still reliant on ADSL or poor FTTC working with integrated care system digital leads as well as the care organisations within those systems to make them aware of the process through which funding can be applied for Expression of interest To be considered for support and funding, you will need to complete an expression of interest form. Please email the team to request a form: bc4hc@nhs.net As part of the process you will also need to complete an application form and provide quotes from your preferred supplier. Deadline for applications Applications must be submitted to NHS Digital by 1 October 2021. Last edited: 9 September 2021 3:15 pm",

This goes on to form their lifelong electronic patient record. The NHS Number helps healthcare staff and service providers to identify and match patients to their health records. Page contents Top tasks Learn more about the NHS number Find out how to use the Personal Demographics Service Registering a birth New births are registered on the Personal Demographics Service (PDS) . The PDS is part of the NHS Spine. This ensures that babies are issued with an NHS Number that is immediately available to organisations involved in the ongoing provision and recording of their care. Midwifery staff will use one of two methods to register a birth: If they are using a PDS-compliant system, they will register the birth directly onto the PDS. This replaces the NHS Number for Babies (NN4B) service, which was decommissioned in early 2015. If they are using a non-PDS compliant system, they will use the Birth Notification Application (BNA) to register the birth onto the PDS. The BNA replaces the former Interim NHS Numbering Service (INNS). This was decommissioned in early 2015. Once the baby's birth has been registered, the PDS notifies the following services about the birth: child health services, the NHS newborn hearing screening service and the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Service benefits The birth notification service: fulfils legal requirements to notify a birth within 36 hours ensures babies receive an NHS Number to support immediate and ongoing care prevents errors and duplicate registrations supports screening for new-borns and infants enables information to be shared between health and care organisations and enables births to be recorded accurately for population statistics. The closure of NHS Numbers for Babies (NN4B) In the past a service called NHS Numbers for Babies (NN4B) was used to allocate NHS Numbers. NN4B has been replaced with equivalent facilities that sit within the Personal Demographics Service, and on the Spine. Users of the legacy NN4B system were migrated to the replacement services and NN4B was decommissioned.

It provides guidance for when you need to submit a birth notification and receive an NHS Number for the baby (or babies). If needed, you may allocate an NHS Number for the mother. About the BNA The BNA is a product owned by NHS Digital which provides a user interface into the Personal Demographics Service (PDS) . The BNA is designed to allow maternity units and child health units to notify births to the respective parties. To achieve this objective the BNA allows authorised users to either: find the mother\u2019s record on the PDS and use the details from that record in the birth notification - this is the normal and preferred method of use allocate an NHS Number (with a skeleton PDS record) for a mother that does not currently have a PDS record and use the newly entered details on the birth notification process the birth notification without entering the mother\u2019s NHS Number - the personal details of the mother will still need to be entered manually in the birth notification Role Based Access code requirements Access to the BNA functionality is controlled by Role Based Access Code (RBAC). Child health units should ensure that users requiring access the BNA have a smartcard with the following assigned to it: Role R8013 Health Records Manager Activities B0264 - Access SCR Application (Perform Patient Trace) B1610 - Allocate NHS Number The RBAC code \u2018B1610 Allocate NHS Number\u2019 is required to allocate an NHS Number. Without it users will only be able to view any saved birth notifications, they will not be allowed to allocate for a mother or to send off birth notifications.

The Allocate tab should only ever be used when you want to allocate an NHS Number for the mother. It should never be used to allocate for the baby. This is because using the Allocate functionality will only create an NHS Number; it will not notify the Office for National Statistics (ONS) or the e-Hearing Screening (eHS) program. If you require an NHS Number for one or more babies then the birth notification process should be used. This will notify the appropriate parties. You should remember that the aim of the process is to submit a birth notification and to receive the NHS Number for a baby, and that this results in the other interested parties being notified of the birth.

The listing and viewing of birth notifications will predominantly be performed by child health units. Maternity units may also use this functionality. Birth notifications may be saved for a number of reasons. They may be: automatically saved as \u2018Complete\u2019 when a successful birth notification is processed automatically saved as \u2018Failed\u2019 when a birth notification is submitted but fails to return an NHS Number - this does not include circumstances that produce validation errors or as a result of duplicate rows saved by the user as \u2018Incomplete\u2019 at any time before the previous two states of \u2018Complete\u2019 or \u2018Failed\u2019 are applied The List Birth Notification screen You can list all birth notifications made by a notifying organisation from this screen. You can list Completed, Failed and Saved (Incomplete) birth notifications by selecting the type required. You need to enter an organisation code and either a date of birth range for the baby or the Saved/Notified date. All of the birth notifications that meet the your entered requirements will be displayed in a list. Up to 50 birth notifications will be displayed in each page - messages will indicate whether you have more pages of notifications. You can then select individual notifications or a group of notifications by using the tick box to the left of the notification. The top tick box in the title banner acts as a \u2018select all\u2019 option. Extracting the birth notifications From the list of matching birth notifications it's possible to extract a group of selected birth notifications to the same csv file. The file can then be used for dual keying or as a basis for inserting the birth notification into a non-PDS compliant maternity system. The name and format of the file is covered in an appendix at the end of this guide . Viewing the birth notifications Any birth notifications that are selected to be viewed will be displayed in the Response screen. If the notification is complete then the standard actions of printing labels and birth notifications will be allowed along with extraction to a csv file. The name and format of the file is covered in an appendix at the end of this guide . Completing the birth notification If the notification is incomplete or failed then the birth notification may be amended and re-submitted for completion. Retention of saved birth notifications Birth notifications are retained for a period of time that is dependent upon its status. \u2018Completed\u2019 Birth Notifications are held for 6 months \u2018Incomplete\u2019 Birth Notifications are held for 14 days \u2018Saved\u2019 Birth Notifications are held for 14 days Last edited: 30 January 2019 3:54 pm Previous Chapter The birth notification process Next Chapter Searching and allocation advice Chapters Birth Notification Application guide for child health Things to know about the Birth Notification Application Allocate or notify The birth notification process Listing and viewing birth notifications Searching and allocation advice Appendices",

Previous Chapter Allocate or notify Current Chapter Current chapter \u2013 The birth notification process View all Next Chapter Listing and viewing birth notifications Page contents Summary This is part 4 of the Birth Notification Application (BNA) guide for child health. Step 1 \u2013 Find the Mother It is very important that you attempt to find the mother first. Ensure that every effort has been made to find the patient before deciding to Allocate, as this helps to ensure that duplicate records for the mother will not be created. The Allocate option will not be available until you've made at least one attempt to find the mother. Before a find has been initiated the Allocate tab is greyed out: Finding a patient \u2013 an exact match found If you enter details that result in a single exact match to an existing record then the matched record details will be displayed. You must decide if the record displayed is the mother for whom you want to enter the birth notification. If the matched record is the mother then you should select the Birth Notification tab and carry on with the birth notification process. If the matched record is not the mother then you should select the \u2018Find a patient\u2019 link on the menu bar and re-enter the details so that the previous matched record is not found. For example, add a first name or a postcode. Finding a patient \u2013 multiple matches found If multiple patients are found for the details you have entered then a list of potential matches are displayed. You should decide if any of the patients displayed in the list is the mother for whom you want to notify a birth. If they are, then select the appropriate record and carry on with the birth notification process. If the patient list does not contain the mother and you need to allocate an NHS Number for the mother, then you should select the Allocate option in the blue banner. Selecting this will bring up the Allocate screen. If the patient list does not contain the mother and you do not need an NHS Number for the mother, but just want to submit the birth notification, then you should select the Birth Notification option in the blue banner. Selecting this will bring up the Birth Notification screen without the mother\u2019s NHS details. Finding a patient \u2013 no matches found If there are no patients found for the details that you entered then two banners will be displayed. A yellow banner will indicate that no patient records match the details you entered. A blue banner will be displayed stating that the \u2018Allocate Tab has been enabled\u2019. The Allocate tab is now available and can be selected to allow the entry of the mother\u2019s details, creation of her PDS record and the allocation of an NHS Number. The mother\u2019s record When a single match has been found for the details you have entered, or you have located and selected the mother\u2019s record from the list of potential candidates, the mother\u2019s record is displayed in the Summary Care Record application. You will be located on the Patient Details tab, like this: You need to select the Birth Notification tab to continue to enter the birth notification. If the Birth Notification tab does not appear it could be because: the smartcard user does not have the correct Role Based Access Code (RBAC) the mother is too young - check the age of the mother the mother is not female - check the gender of the mother Allocate an NHS Number for the mother (optional) The Allocate screen is divided into two sections: Patient Details Usual Address Any details that were entered in the 'Find a patient' screen have now been copied into this screen; you should complete the remaining details that you want to include. Mandatory fields are: Gender (must be female) First name Surname Date of Birth Previous NHS Contact (default is \u2018No\u2019) Usual Address \u2013 House Name or Number and Street Usual Address \u2013 Post town Note that only the mother\u2019s usual (or home) address can be entered. You have the option to enter a contact telephone number for the mother; this can either be a home telephone number or a mobile telephone number. Note: this screen should only be used if you need to allocate an NHS Number for the Mother prior to notifying the birth. Every attempt to find the mother\u2019s PDS record should be made to ensure that duplicate records are not created. Do not use this to allocate an NHS Number for the baby. Address lookup screen You can either enter the details of the Usual Address directly or you can use the address lookup option displayed on the right hand side of the screen. The address lookup screen is only relevant to UK addresses. If you want to use the address lookup then enter the postcode of the mother\u2019s usual address - it will return all of the properties that relate to that postcode. Alternatively, enter the street name and town for the mother. In both cases the correct property can be selected from the resultant list. Entering foreign addresses If you wish to enter a foreign address then you should enter it directly into the mother\u2019s details. As there is no section for country in the address details it is recommended that in the postcode you use the appropriate pseudo country postcode, which will ensure that the correct country is entered in the mother\u2019s records. These are included in an appendix to this document . In this example we are using Belgium and the postcode for Belgium is ZZ99 2DZ. This ensures that when the record is stored the postcode entered will be decoded into the correct country on the mother\u2019s record. This can be seen in the Summary Care Record application (SCRa) patient details screen for the above details. Allocating an NHS Number After all the mother\u2019s details have been entered the blue button marked \u2018Allocate New NHS Number\u2019 should be selected. This will validate all the information entered and either display the appropriate errors or allocate the NHS Number. In this instance the address has been missed and all rows that contain an error have been highlighted in red. All validation errors will be highlighted and these should be rectified. When you are satisfied you have corrected the validation errors then the blue button marked \u2018Allocate New NHS Number\u2019 should be selected again. If there are no errors the NHS Number will be allocated for the mother and a green banner indicating the NHS Number will be displayed. You have now moved automatically to the Birth Notification tab and the dark blue banner at the top of the screen displays the mother\u2019s record (these are the details you have just entered). GP practice It is important to note that PDS, and through it SCRa or BNA cannot perform a GP registration. This means that when you allocate an NHS Number for a mother then she will have a GP practice code of \u2018V81997\u2019 allocated to her. This GP practice code means \u2018Not Registered\u2019. Notify a birth with the mother\u2019s details You will be able to enter the birth notification if you have: traced for and found your mother\u2019s record and subsequently selected the Birth Notification tab allocated the mother\u2019s record As you may not be using the BNA regularly we will break down the whole page into sections and go through each section with the different options. Organisation Details This section is used to describe the location where the delivery occurred and the child health unit(s) that need to know about the baby. This section is dynamic and, depending upon your choice of birth location, the fields that you need to enter will change. Select the type of Delivery Place first using the drop down menu. Birth in an NHS organisation If the baby is born in an NHS hospital then this is the section you will see the following details requested for: You should enter the Organisation Data Service (ODS) code of the location where the birth took place in the 'Delivery Place Code Lookup' box. Then press the 'Check' button. The name of the organisation is now displayed below the code. Please enter a Place of Birth, only one line of Town, County or Country is needed. County and Country can be selected from a drop down list. Enter the Partner CHU details. You can either start to enter the code or the name - as you type a dynamic list of CHUs that match to your entered details are displayed for you to select from. The entry for the Responsible CHU is exactly the same. Birth in a private hospital If the baby is born in another medical facility that is not part of the NHS then this selection will require the following information: You should enter either the name or the ODS code of the delivery location (the code must be checked after entry to ensure that it's on the ODS database). As the name will always be available we recommend that the name is always entered and the code entered if known (and verified). Details for the place of birth and the child health units are as above. Other places of birth If the baby is born at home or it's not known where the baby was born then these details will be required. You must enter either the name (or a description) of the delivery place. It may be beneficial to enter the ODS code of the hospital/maternity unit in the Associated Organisation Code as this may help identify where the baby was taken after birth. Details for the place of birth and the child health units are as above. Notifying person These are the details of the person who is notifying the birth. They are taken directly from the user\u2019s smartcard but may be amended if required. Please note that you will have to verify the Notifying Organisation Code before submitting the birth notification. All of these fields are mandatory and must be entered. Baby details These are the details of the baby and the birth itself. Note that the mother\u2019s surname is automatically copied into the field as this is normal practice. It's possible to amend the surname if required. The date and time of birth cannot be in future. The birth weight is in grams. A birth weight less than 100 will not be accepted. If you enter a birth weight that is regarded as outside the normal range then the following pop-up will be displayed: This is only a warning that the weight entered may be incorrect. Please check the weight and if you have entered the correct value then continue. All of the fields marked with a red asterisk (*) are mandatory. Registering a death or a still birth If the baby dies after birth then the birth should be recorded as 'Live' and a date and time of death entered. If the baby is stillborn then the appropriate category should be selected. The date and time of death entered should be the same as that of the birth. Baby\u2019s usual address and contact details These are the details that have been taken from the mother\u2019s record. They can be amended if required. Baby\u2019s discharge address If the baby is being discharged to an address other than that of the mother\u2019s usual address then that address can be entered here. A discharge address needs an effective until date. This should be no more than 1 month in the future. Submitting the birth notification All of the information for the birth is contained on one page. When all of the information is entered, press the red 'Submit' button. The page will then be validated and any errors displayed with a red banner which must be corrected before the birth notification can be submitted. If no errors are found then the details will be passed to the NHS Personal Demographics Service . An NHS Number will be allocated for the baby, the baby\u2019s record will be created from the details entered and a relationship link called a Mother-Baby Link created between the mother and baby\u2019s PDS Records (and vice versa). The baby\u2019s NHS Number will be returned to the BNA and displayed along with the complete birth notification, which may be printed if required. You can opt to enter another birth for the same mother or a different mother (the option for the same mother will only be available if the birth is a multiple birth). Pressing exit will return you to the 'Find a patient' screen. If you press the blue 'Save' button then the birth notification will be saved without submitting. Saving the birth notification will not return you an NHS Number for the baby. Notify a birth without mother\u2019s details (optional) There may be times when you wish to notify a birth without allocating an NHS Number for the mother. To do this you should still attempt to find the patient. If there are no matches to the criteria you entered, or multiple matches that are not the correct patient record, you can proceed to the birth notification without using a mother\u2019s NHS Number. The option to do so is displayed in the light blue banner (see figure 3 or figure 4 previously in this document). The words 'Birth Notification' are the link to this process. Selecting the link will bring up a pop-up box to ensure that you wish to continue. If you then select OK you will proceed to the Birth Notification screen. Please note that there is no dark blue banner that contains the mother\u2019s details. You will need to enter the mother\u2019s details in this screen (her name, date of birth and address), but no NHS Number is required. All mandatory fields are marked with a red asterisk (*) and the name of the field is in bold. If any validation errors occur then the fields will be highlighted in red and you will not be allowed to continue. Please note that if this action is performed there will be no mother-baby link created as the mother does not have an NHS Number and so will not have a PDS record.

Mandatory fields are: Gender (must be female) First name Surname Date of Birth Previous NHS Contact (default is \u2018No\u2019) Usual Address \u2013 House Name or Number and Street Usual Address \u2013 Post town Note that only the mother\u2019s usual (or home) address can be entered. You have the option to enter a contact telephone number for the mother; this can either be a home telephone number or a mobile telephone number. Note: this screen should only be used if you need to allocate an NHS Number for the Mother prior to notifying the birth. Every attempt to find the mother\u2019s PDS record should be made to ensure that duplicate records are not created. Do not use this to allocate an NHS Number for the baby. Address lookup screen You can either enter the details of the Usual Address directly or you can use the address lookup option displayed on the right hand side of the screen. The address lookup screen is only relevant to UK addresses. If you want to use the address lookup then enter the postcode of the mother\u2019s usual address - it will return all of the properties that relate to that postcode. Alternatively, enter the street name and town for the mother. In both cases the correct property can be selected from the resultant list. Entering foreign addresses If you wish to enter a foreign address then you should enter it directly into the mother\u2019s details. As there is no section for country in the address details it is recommended that in the postcode you use the appropriate pseudo country postcode, which will ensure that the correct country is entered in the mother\u2019s records. These are included in an appendix to this document . In this example we are using Belgium and the postcode for Belgium is ZZ99 2DZ. This ensures that when the record is stored the postcode entered will be decoded into the correct country on the mother\u2019s record. This can be seen in the Summary Care Record application (SCRa) patient details screen for the above details. Allocating an NHS Number After all the mother\u2019s details have been entered the blue button marked \u2018Allocate New NHS Number\u2019 should be selected. This will validate all the information entered and either display the appropriate errors or allocate the NHS Number. In this instance the address has been missed and all rows that contain an error have been highlighted in red. All validation errors will be highlighted and these should be rectified. When you are satisfied you have corrected the validation errors then the blue button marked \u2018Allocate New NHS Number\u2019 should be selected again. If there are no errors the NHS Number will be allocated for the mother and a green banner indicating the NHS Number will be displayed. You have now moved automatically to the Birth Notification tab and the dark blue banner at the top of the screen displays the mother\u2019s record (these are the details you have just entered). GP practice It is important to note that PDS, and through it SCRa or BNA cannot perform a GP registration. This means that when you allocate an NHS Number for a mother then she will have a GP practice code of \u2018V81997\u2019 allocated to her. This GP practice code means \u2018Not Registered\u2019. Notify a birth with the mother\u2019s details You will be able to enter the birth notification if you have: traced for and found your mother\u2019s record and subsequently selected the Birth Notification tab allocated the mother\u2019s record As you may not be using the BNA regularly we will break down the whole page into sections and go through each section with the different options. Organisation Details This section is used to describe the location where the delivery occurred and the child health unit(s) that need to know about the baby. This section is dynamic and, depending upon your choice of birth location, the fields that you need to enter will change. Select the type of Delivery Place first using the drop down menu. Birth in an NHS organisation If the baby is born in an NHS hospital then this is the section you will see the following details requested for: You should enter the Organisation Data Service (ODS) code of the location where the birth took place in the 'Delivery Place Code Lookup' box. Then press the 'Check' button. The name of the organisation is now displayed below the code. Please enter a Place of Birth, only one line of Town, County or Country is needed. County and Country can be selected from a drop down list. Enter the Partner CHU details. You can either start to enter the code or the name - as you type a dynamic list of CHUs that match to your entered details are displayed for you to select from. The entry for the Responsible CHU is exactly the same. Birth in a private hospital If the baby is born in another medical facility that is not part of the NHS then this selection will require the following information: You should enter either the name or the ODS code of the delivery location (the code must be checked after entry to ensure that it's on the ODS database). As the name will always be available we recommend that the name is always entered and the code entered if known (and verified). Details for the place of birth and the child health units are as above. Other places of birth If the baby is born at home or it's not known where the baby was born then these details will be required. You must enter either the name (or a description) of the delivery place. It may be beneficial to enter the ODS code of the hospital/maternity unit in the Associated Organisation Code as this may help identify where the baby was taken after birth. Details for the place of birth and the child health units are as above. Notifying person These are the details of the person who is notifying the birth. They are taken directly from the user\u2019s smartcard but may be amended if required. Please note that you will have to verify the Notifying Organisation Code before submitting the birth notification. All of these fields are mandatory and must be entered. Baby details These are the details of the baby and the birth itself. Note that the mother\u2019s surname is automatically copied into the field as this is normal practice. It's possible to amend the surname if required. The date and time of birth cannot be in future. The birth weight is in grams. A birth weight less than 100 will not be accepted. If you enter a birth weight that is regarded as outside the normal range then the following pop-up will be displayed: This is only a warning that the weight entered may be incorrect. Please check the weight and if you have entered the correct value then continue. All of the fields marked with a red asterisk (*) are mandatory. Registering a death or a still birth If the baby dies after birth then the birth should be recorded as 'Live' and a date and time of death entered. If the baby is stillborn then the appropriate category should be selected. The date and time of death entered should be the same as that of the birth. Baby\u2019s usual address and contact details These are the details that have been taken from the mother\u2019s record. They can be amended if required. Baby\u2019s discharge address If the baby is being discharged to an address other than that of the mother\u2019s usual address then that address can be entered here. A discharge address needs an effective until date. This should be no more than 1 month in the future. Submitting the birth notification All of the information for the birth is contained on one page. When all of the information is entered, press the red 'Submit' button. The page will then be validated and any errors displayed with a red banner which must be corrected before the birth notification can be submitted. If no errors are found then the details will be passed to the NHS Personal Demographics Service . An NHS Number will be allocated for the baby, the baby\u2019s record will be created from the details entered and a relationship link called a Mother-Baby Link created between the mother and baby\u2019s PDS Records (and vice versa). The baby\u2019s NHS Number will be returned to the BNA and displayed along with the complete birth notification, which may be printed if required. You can opt to enter another birth for the same mother or a different mother (the option for the same mother will only be available if the birth is a multiple birth). Pressing exit will return you to the 'Find a patient' screen. If you press the blue 'Save' button then the birth notification will be saved without submitting. Saving the birth notification will not return you an NHS Number for the baby. Notify a birth without mother\u2019s details (optional) There may be times when you wish to notify a birth without allocating an NHS Number for the mother. To do this you should still attempt to find the patient. If there are no matches to the criteria you entered, or multiple matches that are not the correct patient record, you can proceed to the birth notification without using a mother\u2019s NHS Number. The option to do so is displayed in the light blue banner (see figure 3 or figure 4 previously in this document). The words 'Birth Notification' are the link to this process. Selecting the link will bring up a pop-up box to ensure that you wish to continue. If you then select OK you will proceed to the Birth Notification screen. Please note that there is no dark blue banner that contains the mother\u2019s details. You will need to enter the mother\u2019s details in this screen (her name, date of birth and address), but no NHS Number is required. All mandatory fields are marked with a red asterisk (*) and the name of the field is in bold. If any validation errors occur then the fields will be highlighted in red and you will not be allowed to continue. Please note that if this action is performed there will be no mother-baby link created as the mother does not have an NHS Number and so will not have a PDS record.

      "content": "Birth Notification Application guide for maternity Publication date : 29 Jan 2019 Skip to content Page contents Summary This user guide is intended for maternity users of the Birth Notification Application (BNA). It provides guidance for when you need to submit a birth notification and receive an NHS Number for the baby (or babies). If needed, you may allocate an NHS Number for the mother. Introduction The NHS Numbers for Babies/Central Issuing Service (NN4B/CIS) system and the Interim NHS Numbering System (INNS) have been discontinued. The majority of sites will migrate to a Personal Demographics Service (PDS) compliant maternity or child health system that will integrate the local system with the PDS. There will be a number of sites that, for whatever reason, will not be migrated onto a PDS compliant maternity or child health system by this time. These sites will need a mechanism to allow users to register a birth and obtain an NHS Number for the baby. The mechanism to do this is called the Birth Notification Application (BNA). The BNA contains all the functionality currently in the CIS or INNS, along with some additional features. The BNA will allow users to: trace for a mother\u2019s PDS record create a record on the PDS for the mother when no record exists (for the baby) enter details for the birth notification and create a new record on the PDS including allocating an NHS Number print birth notifications, blood spot labels and identity wristbands view stored birth notifications For maternity sites that do not have a PDS compliant maternity system, users will need to enter the details of the birth into both the local maternity or PAS system and the BNA. This dual keying is necessary because there is no link from the local maternity system or patient administration system (PAS) to the PDS. This document has been written to help midwives using the BNA system.

Previous Chapter Searching and allocation advice Current Chapter Current chapter \u2013 Entering birth details into another system View all Next Chapter Appendix A - exporting the birth notifications to a file Page contents Summary This is part 7 of the Birth Notification Application (BNA) guide for maternity. The Birth Notification Application has a number of possible outputs that may assist you in entering the new-born details to non-PDS compliant systems. Birth notification print The first method is to use the printed result of the birth notification process. This printed result will contain all of the entered details for the birth and the NHS Number allocated by the PDS. It is possible to collate these printed birth notifications and use them in a back office procedure to enter the birth details onto your local system. This could be done singly or in bulk, and performed when time and necessity permit. Birth notification extract The second method would be to extract the details from a birth notification. The extract will either be for a single birth notification if the export was taken from the Birth Notification Response screen, or for multiple birth notifications if the export was taken from the List Birth Notification screen. This comma delimited file (.csv format) can then be used as a basis to enter details onto the local system. Where local IT services allow, or if the facility can be provided by the local system supplier, this file may be used as the source for an automatic upload to the local system. Data elements The following data elements are included on both the printed birth notification and the extracted file: Baby\u2019s NHS Number Baby\u2019s Forename, Othername 6 and Surname Baby\u2019s Sex Baby\u2019s Date and Time of Birth Baby\u2019s Usual Address Baby\u2019s Discharge Address and Discharge Address Effective To Date 7 Birth Weight (in grams) Birth Order Number of Births in Confinement Gestation Period (in weeks) Suspected Congenital Abnormality Indicator Ethnic Category Live or Still Born Indicator Date and Time of Death Mother\u2019s NHS Number Mother\u2019s Forename and Surname Mother\u2019s Date of Birth Partner Child Health Organisation Code and Name Responsible Child Health Organisation Code and Name Delivery Place Type and Name Notifying Organisation Code and Name Notifying Person Forename and Surname. Practice Code and Name GP Code and GP Name Practice Address Place of Birth Type Place of Birth Name 8 Place of Birth (Town, County, Country) 9 The .csv extract also has status of the birth notification and the Saved/Notified date. 6 Othername only appears in the .csv file. 7 Effective To Date only appears in the .csv file. 8 Place of Birth Name only appears in the .csv file. 9 Place of Birth Town, County and Country only appears in the .csv file.

The listing and viewing of birth notifications will predominantly be performed by child health units. Maternity units may also use this functionality. Birth notifications may be saved for a number of reasons. They may be: automatically saved as \u2018Complete\u2019 when a successful birth notification is processed automatically saved as \u2018Failed\u2019 when a birth notification is submitted but fails to return an NHS Number - this does not include circumstances that produce validation errors or as a result of duplicate rows saved by the user as \u2018Incomplete\u2019 at any time before the previous two states of \u2018Complete\u2019 or \u2018Failed\u2019 are applied The List Birth Notification screen You can list all birth notifications made by a notifying organisation from this screen. You can list Completed, Failed and Saved (Incomplete) birth notifications by selecting the type required. You need to enter an organisation code and either a date of birth range for the baby or the Saved/Notified date. All of the birth notifications that meet the your entered requirements will be displayed in a list. Up to 50 birth notifications will be displayed in each page - messages will indicate whether you have more pages of notifications. You can then select individual notifications or a group of notifications by using the tick box to the left of the notification. The top tick box in the title banner acts as a \u2018select all\u2019 option. Extracting the birth notifications From the list of matching birth notifications you can extract a group of selected birth notifications to the same csv file. The file can then be used for dual keying or as a basis for inserting the birth notification into a non-PDS compliant maternity system. The name and format of the file is covered in an appendix at the end of this guide . Viewing the birth notifications Any Birth Notifications you select to be viewed will be displayed in the Response screen. If the notification is complete then the standard actions of printing labels and birth notifications will be allowed, along with extraction to a csv file. The name and format of the file is covered in an appendix at the end of this guide . Completing the birth notification If the notification is incomplete or failed then the birth notification may be amended and re-submitted for completion. Retention of saved birth notifications Birth notifications are retained for a period of time that is dependent upon its status. \u2018Completed\u2019 Birth Notifications are held for 6 months \u2018Incomplete\u2019 Birth Notifications are held for 14 days \u2018Saved\u2019 Birth Notifications are held for 14 days Last edited: 8 February 2019 2:05 pm Previous Chapter Registering a birth Next Chapter Searching and allocation advice Chapters Birth Notification Application guide for maternity Things to know about the Birth Notification Application Accessing the Birth Notification Application Registering a birth Listing and viewing birth notifications Searching and allocating advice Entering birth details into another system Appendix A - exporting the birth notifications to a file",

      "content": "Birth Notification Application guide for maternity Registering a birth Skip to content Page contents Summary This is part 4 of the Birth Notification Application (BNA) guide for maternity. Registering a birth is predominantly performed by the Maternity Units, and the following diagram summarises the main steps: Allocation of the mother\u2019s NHS Number is only carried out when all possible routes to find the mother\u2019s NHS Number or find her record on the PDS have failed. Most mothers will have a record on the PDS and an associated NHS Number. If the mother is registered with a GP they will already have an NHS Number and an allocation should not be performed. Instead further efforts should be made to find the mother\u2019s PDS record. Section 6 'Searching and allocation advice' contains detailed searching and allocation guidance. Finding the mother\u2019s record The initial step in the birth notification process is always to trace for the mother. It's important that all efforts are made to find the mother\u2019s PDS record - this will ensure that all the correct details are used and will avoid duplicate records being created. You should take care to ensure that the record selected is for the correct mother. This will avoid the mother\u2019s record becoming confused with another and prevent the baby's details from being linked to the wrong mother. The 'Find a patient' screen After accessing the SCRa you will be presented with the 'Find a patient' screen which allows you to find a mother\u2019s PDS record. Tracing methods Finding or tracing for a patient on the PDS using an NHS Number is always the best method of finding a unique match to an existing PDS record. Mothers who have been referred from primary care should always be referred for maternity care with their NHS Number. However, an NHS Number may not always be available or known. In these cases other available details, such as name, gender, date of birth and address should be used. The Searching Tips section has further guidance. If a single PDS record is found for the details entered, then the mother\u2019s demographic details are displayed. If multiple PDS records match the search criteria entered then they will be displayed in a Patient List. From the list you can carefully select the correct mother\u2019s PDS record to be used in the birth notification. If you're unable to find the mother\u2019s PDS record then alternative searches should be attempted. The Searching Tips section has further guidance. If you can't find a PDS record for the mother, and you're confident that you've attempted all possible means to find a record, then you can select the Allocate option. This will create a new PDS record for the mother and allocate an NHS Number for them (see ' Allocating an NHS Number for the Mother '). It's also possible to progress to the Birth Notification screen with no mother\u2019s PDS record found and no known NHS Number for the mother - this should only be performed when no record exists and it is not possible to allocate an NHS Number for the mother. Continue to the birth notification Confirm mother\u2019s PDS record When you have confirmed the correct mother\u2019s PDS record the demographic details are displayed for the mother. You can now select the Birth Notification tab to enter the birth notification details. Please note that you will not be able to continue to enter a birth notification if the selected PDS record is: not female female and under the age of 10 years No confirmed mother\u2019s PDS record If you have attempted all possible searches for the mother\u2019s record, but found no matching record, and cannot allocate an NHS Number for the mother, then you should not select any of the returned rows (if any exist). You should instead select the 'Proceed to Birth Notification without Mother\u2019s NHS Number' option by selecting the \u2018Birth Notification\u2019 link. This will allow you to complete the birth notification without a mother\u2019s NHS Number. You can allocate an NHS Number to the mother if you have attempted all possible searches for their record, but no matching record has been found. You should select the Allocate option and proceed to allocate a new NHS Number for the mother. These allocated details will be passed to the 'Enter Birth Notification' screen. Mother\u2019s PDS record is incorrect If you've attempted all possible traces for the mother, and you find a match to a PDS record that is not up-to-date (for example the address details are incorrect or the surname has changed), you should: confirm the patient using the old details, correct the details using the SCRa select the \u2018Birth Notification\u2019 and enter the birth notification details. Partial record returned for a mother If when searching for the mother\u2019s PDS record you discover that only a partial record is returned containing no address details, it means mother\u2019s location details are being protected. The following procedure should be taken: Continue to the Birth Notification tab and enter details of the birth. Request the patient\u2019s address; The address can be verified on entry You can reassure the mother that the details are not stored on the PDS and their PDS record status will not be amended. If the Mother doesn't wish to give their address then enter the address of the maternity ward as the Usual Address and follow local (manual) procedures to inform the child health unit of the mother\u2019s correct address from this point. Complete the Birth Notification. Allocating an NHS Number for the mother If you have attempted to search for the mother\u2019s PDS record and are confident that the record does not exist, then you may allocate an NHS Number for the mother. Remember, you must have tried all possible means of searching to find the mother\u2019s PDS record, and must be confident that no PDS record exists, before performing an allocation for the mother. You should follow these guidance principles before considering to add a new patient record to the PDS: Most patients will already have a record on the PDS and an NHS Number. Referrals from GPs should have the patient's NHS Number. Most duplicates are created because the patient has not been identified correctly and therefore not traced on the PDS. If there is any doubt about the patient\u201fs identity don't allocate. Limit the ability to allocate to a very small number of highly trained staff. Failure to follow these principles will result in the creation of duplicate records on the PDS. This means: significant additional work is needed both nationally by the National Back Office and locally, by all organisations that have had contact with the patient, to resolve the duplication a clinical is created risk for the patient - the existence of more than one PDS record means that organisations providing care may not identify the correct health record The PDS record that is created is not a full PDS record. It contains only the minimal data required to create both a record on the PDS and the birth notification for the baby. The Allocate screen If you want to allocate an NHS Number for a mother then you'll need to enter the mother's: surname forename date of birth address - the house name/flat number or house number/street must be entered, plus the postal town other names (optional) telephone number (optional) When you have entered the details you select to allocate the NHS Number for the mother, and the NHS Number is returned. Then, control will be passed automatically to the Enter Birth Notification screen. Defaulted data The GP practice code will be defaulted to \u2018V81997\u2019 (Not Registered). Note that the allocation will not perform the registration at a GP practice. If the mother has a GP then they will already have an NHS Number and you should not perform an allocation. Instead further efforts should be made to find the mother\u2019s PDS record. Previous NHS contact If the person has had previous NHS contact then they may have an NHS Number. If the patient has had previous contact select \u2018Yes\u2019. Entering a birth notification This screen is used to enter all of the details for the birth notification. It contains details for the mother, the baby, the birth, the place of birth and the notifying person. Control will be passed here after you have either: selected a mother\u2019s PDS record allocated an NHS Number for the mother\u2019s PDS record ensured that an NHS Number is not required for the mother and continued to the birth notification The Birth Notification screen All of the existing birth notification details used in the NHS Number for Babies (NN4B)/Care Identity Service (CIS) system or on Interim NHS Numbering System (INNS) are included here. There are no new details. All of the details are to be entered on one screen. Some details will be carried forward from the mother\u2019s PDS record. Additional details will be taken from your smartcard in order to minimise the amount of information that you need to enter. Initial display from Find a Patient or Allocate screens The table below shows the details that are pre-populated upon entry into this screen. Field name Source May be amended?

This option is only available if you are entering a multiple birth (that is - that the Number of Births in Confinement is greater than one). 1 If you amend the Notifying Organisation Code then this value will be derived from the newly entered value. 2 If you amend the Partner Organisation Code then this value will be derived from the newly entered value. 3 If you amend the Responsible Organisation Code then this value will be derived from the newly entered value. 4 If you amend the Notifying Organisation Code then this value will be derived from the newly entered value. Duplicate checking After submitting a birth notification the details are validated. Any errors or omissions will be highlighted. If there are no errors then a birth notification will be submitted to the PDS where a number of checks are performed to ensure that it is not a duplicate. If the submitted details are similar to an existing birth notification this is classified as a \u2018potential duplicate\u2019. A list of these potential matches are displayed to you. You should browse the list of potential matches and confirm that the details you have submitted are unique. If this is the case then re-submit the Birth Notification. The birth notification will be sent to the PDS without further duplicate checks. If the submitted details are an exact duplicate of an existing birth notification an error message displayed. It is not possible to re-submit an exact match. Response following the submission of a birth notification After submitting a birth notification a Response screen will be displayed that shows all of the information included in the birth notification and the outcome of the submission. Failed submission If an error occurs after submitting a birth notification an error banner will be displayed across the top of the screen indicating why the submission has failed. The birth notification will be saved to allow you to meet any local business procedures that need to be carried out. The failed submission can be managed in the list birth notifications screen. Successful submission After successfully allocating an NHS Number for the birth notification, a response screen is displayed. This displays the baby\u2019s NHS Number and all of the details that have been entered. A number of options are available following a successful birth notification. These options are: Printing the birth notification This option allows you to print the birth notification as part of a discharge notice, or as a means to pass information to child health units in the event of an error or a failure in obtaining an NHS Number for the baby. These birth notifications can also be used as part of the local process for dual-keying if they are required. Printing the blood spot labels The blood spot labels must be attached to the newborn blood spot card. This includes all of the information required when processing the test. The labels can also be used on other physical media, such as printed medical records. There are two types of label; with and without barcoded NHS Numbers for the baby. Printing identity wristbands You can print out two identity bracelets for the baby if you have a thermal transfer printer 5 . These bracelets must fastened to the ankle and wrist of the baby to ensure identification. Entering another birth notification There are two options here; to enter another birth: for the same mother (if the Number of Births in Confinement is greater than 1, such as a multiple birth) for a different mother 5 The BNA has been written and tested using the Zebra HC100 and the Zebra GK420t thermal transfer printers.

Download the original print version of this guide . Page contents Searching for the mother Search for the mother's recordby using either Basic Search or Advanced Search. Basic Search Basic Search will only find a record when there is an exact match to all the search criteria provided. The demographic details of the found patient record will be displayed. Advanced Search Advanced Search will find all of the records that match the details entered. All resultant records will be displayed in a patient list. The correct patient record should be selected by cross-referencing with other details. Providing a maternal NHS Number on the registration is important because it allows the mother\u2019s and baby\u2019s records to be linked together. Mothers registered with a general practice will always have an NHS Number and every effort should be made to find the correct number. In the event that a mother without an NHS Number does attend the maternity unit, then a number can be allocated for the mother using BNA. Please refer to the BNA guidance documentation for further information. Entering the birth notification details Select the Birth Notification tab. Any appropriate information from the mother\u2019s details and from your smartcard are automatically entered into the birth notification fields. This information can be amended if needed. You should now enter the details of the birth. Any field that is in bold and marked with a single asterisk (*) is a mandatory field. Any group of fields that are marked with two asterisks (**) will need at least one item from the group to be entered. If you encounter a problem or are unsure of any of the birth details then you can save your progress. You can rectify the problem or verify the details before completing the birth notification. After you've entered all of the details you know, select the Submit button. This will validate the data entered, highlighting any missing data or errors. Please ensure that the data entered is correct. Once the birth notification has been submitted the details cannot be amended. If the details are successfully validated, then the birth notification is saved, and the NHS Number for the infant is displayed in a popup box containing the details that have been entered. You can choose to print any or all of the following: The completed birth notification. The blood spot labels with or without the infant's NHS Number in barcoded form. Identity wristbands for the infant. All printed objects will be displayed in a pdf window and can be sent to any appropriate printer. You will also be presented with the option to enter a birth for a different mother. This will return you to the search screens to find the mother. If you have been entering details for a Multiple Birth, then you will be presented with the option to enter a birth for the same mother. This will return you to the Enter Birth Notification tab and will have pre-populated a lot of the details on this screen that relate to the place of birth, the mother and the notifying person. These details may be amended if it is appropriate to do so. The process of entering a birth notification can be broken down into these steps: Listing the birth notification details Select the List Birth Notifications menu option to list birth notifications for a given organisation. You can select to see any combination of birth notifications that are: completed - these are saved automatically when a birth notification is successful incomplete - these are saved at the request of the users and have not been completed failed - when the birth notification passes validation but fails to return an NHS Number these are saved at the request of the users Check the appropriate boxes for the birth notifications status that you require to list. Enter the organisation code and enter a date range for either the baby\u2019s date of birth or the Saved/Notified date. Now select the 'Refresh List' button and the list of birth notifications that meet your criteria will be displayed with up to 50 entries per page. The list can be re-sorted using the sort arrows in the title box to sort in ascending or descending order. Additionally it can be filtered using the \u2018Filter Results\u2019 box. A minimum of 3 characters are required, and only results that contain the entered details from this box will be displayed. It is possible to then select all or some of the birth notifications by checking the tick boxes. This will allow you to: View the entered details for the selected birth notification(s). A failed or incomplete birth notification can be completed and you can perform all print options for completed birth notifications. It is possible to scroll through the birth notifications. Print the selected birth notification(s). The details of each birth notification will be printed on a separate sheet of paper. Export the selected birth notification(s) into a csv file. This will contain all of the selected birth notifications, each on a different row. Export all of the listed birth notification(s) into a csv file.

      "content": "Booking and Referral Standard The Booking and Referral Standard is an interoperability standard for healthcare IT systems that enables booking and referral information to be sent between NHS service providers quickly, safely and in a format that is useful to clinicians. It will eventually be available in all care settings. Page contents About BaRS A patient journey - from the patient presenting with symptoms, to appropriate treatment then discharge - will often involve two or more NHS services. Booking, clinical and administrative information need to follow the patient at all stages of this journey. This often involves paper processes and using multiple healthcare IT systems which can be inefficient. The Booking and Referral Standard (BaRS) ensures healthcare professionals receive the information they need, in a format they can use, integrated into their existing healthcare IT systems. It will first be implemented within two care journeys: between 999 and clinical assessment services (CAS) for referral or ambulance validation between NHS 111 and emergency departments (also known as accident and emergency or A&E) The experience gained from the two initial implementations will help to improve the standard ahead of making it available to all appropriate NHS services in England, such as pharmacy and dentistry, via their healthcare IT systems. What is an interoperability standard? An \u2018interoperability standard\u2019 describes a standardised set of rules, that govern the format, language and delivery methods for transferring data or information from any healthcare IT systems to another. In the case of BaRS, it helps a service to send or receive booking and referral information to or from another care provider for the purpose of a patient's ongoing care. If all care settings adopt the same interoperability standard for sending and receiving referrals, it makes it easier, faster and safer to move patients through their care journey. We are going to: build the necessary national infrastructure and components that will underpin delivery of BaRS provide a messaging standard that allows multiple systems to communicate with each other in a simple and logical way publish a standard that supports the administrative task of booking a patient into their next care setting, as well as providing the correct and relevant clinical referral information to care givers so that they can make or accept a patient referral produce a standard that is accepted, agreed and adopted by health care system providers and rolled out across the health system to improve patient experience and care outcomes Benefits of the Booking and Referral Standard An interoperability standard for patient booking and referrals will have several benefits. Patients will: be able to efficiently book appointments and time slots with the service that's right for them get the right advice and treatment when they most need it, safely and easily Healthcare workers will: receive the information they require, and in sufficient detail, to enable them to undertake the patient care activity requested be able to triage the patient without asking them to unnecessarily repeat information already collected earlier in their journey send and receive booking and referral data that is integrated into existing healthcare IT systems - this avoids working across 2 or more applications or systems and saves time IT suppliers and care providers should find it easier and more efficient to implement a single, agreed national interoperability standard, rather than supporting the multiple and varied standards currently in operation. Commissioners and Integrated Care Systems will find it easier to integrate care journeys across care settings using existing systems. A recent government report has acknowledged the work already done in this area and the benefits of sharing booking and referral data between healthcare IT systems and across care settings: The join up of 111 and accident and emergency (A&E) departments through digital information has helped keep A&E departments safe by enabling 111 to directly book GP, pharmacy, and outpatient appointments.

      "content": "Information governance This page outlines BaRS information governance policy and the detail of the BaRS privacy notice. Page contents Information governance An NHS England Direction to enable NHS Digital to develop an interoperability standard for patient record systems and a related API (Booking and Referral Standard Service) has been published for the BaRS programme. A record has also be added to the NHS Digital GDPR Register . BaRS Privacy Notice - A note for healthcare providers Healthcare providers using BaRS are responsible for transparency to patients. If patients do not understand that their data is traversing NHS England systems as part of the referral service, there could be a breach of the fairness principle of UK GDPR. BaRS, developed by NHS England, does not directly collect any information except in the case of 111 online. NHS England does not store any personal data except for 'online identifiers' of sending and receiving providers, e.g. IP Address/Event Logs and the NHS Number (if provided) which is stored for audit purposes. We encourage all healthcare providers who will be using BaRS to review the Privacy Notice and update their transparency information accordingly. View the BaRS Privacy Notice What type of information we have: The Booking and Referral Standard is an interoperability standard for patient record systems that enables booking and referral information to be sent between NHS service providers quickly, safely and in a format that is useful to clinicians. The data that traverses the NHS England infrastructure in the form of messages is a combination of personal data and special category. NHS England will only collect audit and monitoring data for the Booking and Referral Standard. Alongside the Standard, information models are developed with the NHS England policy teams that define the booking and service request and confirm the data items that will travel with the request. These information models are typically endorsed by an appropriate body e.g. PRSB for 111 \u2013 ED and the Clinical Reference Group (CRG) for GP-Pharmacy. The statutory functions of NHS Digital transferred to NHS England under the Health and Social Care Information Centre (Transfer of Functions, Abolition and Transitional Provisions) Regulations 2023 (Transfer Regulations) with effect from 1st February 2023 (Transfer Date). Under the Transfer Regulations, all directions by either the Secretary of State or NHS England to NHS Digital are now treated as directions made by the Secretary of State to NHS England except for system delivery directions issued by NHS England to NHS Digital, which come to an end. In such cases NHS England may provide the BARS technical system under Section 2 and Section 1H of the National Health Service Act 2006 (arranging services for the purposes of the health service in England) together with Section 13E (Duty as to improvement in quality of services) and Section 13 N (Duty as to promoting integration) and perhaps 13YA Power of NHS England to provide assistance and support. Service providers on the sending system will collect the following mandatory data items, which will be carried in the payload and used by the receiving system to verify the patients\u2019 details. NHS England will not store these data items. Name Address Postcode DOB There are a number of recommended data items for system suppliers that they can choose to use dependent upon their system configuration. The BaRS system will not store this data: Sex Gender Home phone number Mobile phone number The following data items will be stored in Splunk by NHS England for audit purposes when it is included in a BaRS API request: General identifier - NHS Number can be collected by the sending and receiving organisation Online identifier Special Category Data Physical / Mental Health or Condition - The clinical referral information will be transported via the BaRS API across the NHS England network, but it is not stored as an asset by the BaRS system. How we get the information and why we have it: Data items are collected by sending and receiving systems when a sending organisation makes the booking and referral request; they use the API to send the payload to the receiving organisation. System suppliers will have the option to include a number of optional data items based on the relevant information model. To the extent that any personal data is processed by NHS England in the provision of the BaRS Service, NHS England's lawful basis will be: UK GDPR Article 6(1)(c) - legal obligation (the Direction issued under section 254 of the 2012 Act is a legal obligation on NHS England to process personal data from providers to the extent necessary to provide the Booking and Referral Standard Service. UK GDPR Article (6)(e) \u2013 public task in relation to the delivery of the technical system for BARS. To the extent that any special categories of personal data are processed by NHS England in the provision of the BaRS Service, the Article 9 condition for doing so will be one or both of: UK GDPR Article 9(2)(g) - processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, supplemented by: DPA 2018 \u2013 Schedule 1, Part 2, (6) (1) \u2013 statutory etc and government purposes UK GDPR Article 9 (2) (h) \u2013 processing is necessary for the management of health or social care systems and services, supplemented by: DPA 2018 \u2013 Schedule 1, Part 1, (2) (2) (f) \u2013 Health or social care purposes. What we do with the information we have: NHS England does not collect the personal data directly from patients except in the case of 111 online which NHS England is controller for. The personal data is collected by the sending and receiving systems to enable a booking and referral to be made using the BaRS API. The data that traverses the NHS England infrastructure in the form of messages (payload) is a combination of personal data and special category. NHS England will only collect BARS API transactional data for the Booking and Referral Standard. How we store your information: NHS England is the trusted national provider of high-quality information, data and IT systems for health and social care. Information is the core business of NHS England and it is NHS England's duty to keep information safe. An information asset has been created for the Booking and Referral Standard and an Information Asset Owner (IAO) assigned. An IAO is a senior member of NHS England staff who is responsible for the management of the information asset created and utilised by their team. The IAO role is mandatory across all government departments. NHS England does not collect patients personal data. The only data that will be stored by NHS England is BaRS API transactional data on splunk, this will be stored for 90 days only Your data protection rights: Under data protection law, you have rights including: Your right to be informed \u2013 You have the right to be informed about when your personal data is being used Your right of access - You have the right to ask us for copies of your personal information.

What it is used for We collect information from GP practices either: automatically from the practice clinical records system through the General Practice Extraction Service (GPES); or manually directly into the Calculating Quality Reporting Service This information is used to help practices track and manage their performance against various targets and enhanced services frameworks set for them by NHS England . Data is used to help track: the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) Direct Enhanced Services (DES) Vaccination and Immunisation (V&I) the GP workload tool the National Diabetes Audit It forms part of our GP Collections service. How it works NHS England negotiates GP contracts on an annual basis. Once this is completed, the service information is made available on the CQRS system. Commissioning organisations, such as the NHS England regional offices, then offer out these services for GP practices to accept. Once approved, the aggregated, non-patient identifiable data is shared with CQRS by participating practices.CQRS calculates a Quality Service Achievement based on the data it receives, and relevant payments are made through the National Health Applications and Infrastructure Services (NHAIS) system.

      "content": "Primary care networks \u2013 commissioners user guide This guide is for commissioners issuing offers of participation for the primary care networks (PCN) services on Calculating Quality Reporting Service (CQRS). Published August 2020 Page contents Introduction Creating offers for PCN services will follow a different process to non-PCN services. There are also changes to how commissioners will view PCN service information in CQRS. PCN services are offered to GP practices from the lead commissioning organisation through the PCN as a whole entity - commissioners cannot deselect GP practices. If an organisation leaves the network early, CQRS will automatically end their participation. These services can use a new value called Weighted Practice List Size (WPLS) which is a modified version of CRP, and this will be automatically populated in CQRS for calculation. New network contract Directed Enhanced Service (DES) Services These are the new network contract DES services available on CQRS for financial year 2020/21. The Primary Care Networks 2021 service will include an automated data extract from GP practices via GPES. There are four services which will not involve a data extract and will be used for calculation and payment purposes. These are: PCN Core PCN Funding 2021 PCN Clinical Director Payment 2021 PCN Extended Hours Access Payments 2021 PCN Network Participation Payments 2021 (practice level, not a PCN service) New user roles In CQRS There will be two new user roles available in CQRS. PCN View PCN View is available to GP Practice and PCN organisations. It allows access to: new dashboards that allow the user to view all GP practices within their PCN including data submission details and payment declaration details expanded reporting to enable users to view additional organisations PCN Management PCN Management is available to PCN organisations. It gives access to: new dashboards that allow the user to view all GP practices within their PCN, including data submission details and payment declaration details add/update GP practice data within their PCN expanded reporting to enable users to view additional organisations Participation management There have been some changes to the participation management process for PCN services. Offers will be made by commissioners but auto-accepted \u2013 practices will not be required to accept the offer. Step 3 of the non-PCN process is skipped because it is automatically offered to all GP practices associated with the PCN(s) under this lead CCG. Create an offer Step 1 \u2013 Select a Quality Service Select the PCN service that you wish to offer out. Step 2 \u2013 Define Service Details This is where you will automate the offer. Tick the 'Automatically Accept Offer' box and press continue. You will skip step 3 as PCN services will be automatically offered to all GP practices associated with the PCN(s) under this lead CCG. Step 4 \u2013 Review Review the offer and press submit, then go to Step 5 and submit the offer. Offered services Offered Services will have a new transition page when a PCN service is selected. The first page will show the list of PCN\u2019s. Once you select the link, you will see the 'Associated Service Providers' as usual. Cancel Service function can only be applied for the whole PCN, not individual practices or service providers. Data submission tab \u2013 new network achievement page Displays a dashboard for those with the PCN View or PCN Management user roles and Data Submission access. This page only displays PCN services. Commissioners can click on the 'Service Provider Name' to go to 'Record Provider Achievement'. Achievement tab \u2013 new payment declaration approval process PCN payments will be aggregated into one payment declaration. Payment amounts start the process at the GP practice level for initial review and approval. PCN services will use the 'Auto-Declare' feature. Once an individual payment amount within a PCN is approved, it is moved to the new \u2018Awaiting Network Achievement\u2019 status to wait for 100% of the payment declarations to be approved by the commissioning organisation before moving on for final approvals. Once 100% threshold is met, the individual payments are summed into an aggregated payment declaration for the PCN. These payments will be made to the nominated payee (or PCN directly if no nominated payee exists). New tasks and messages will keep commissioners informed of the status of the payment declarations within the PCN. Achievement tab \u2013 new Network Declaration Management page Displays a dashboard those with the PCN View or PCN Management user roles and Achievement access. This page only displays PCN services. Report changes Added to various reports, for ease of reference, will be: PCN org name Nominated payee name WPLS value Additionally, access will be expanded when applicable to allow service providers the ability to run reports for their peers within their PCN. This is associated with the PCN View user role. Aggregated payment detail will be accessible on new top-level reports similar to the provider payment declaration. Contact Any queries about the Primary Care Networks contract or policy should be directed to NHS England \u2013 England.gpcontracts@nhs.net . General PCN queries should be directed to NHS England via England.pcn@nhs.net . Technical CQRS queries should be directed to support@cqrs.co.uk . General queries can be sent to cqrsfeedback@nhs.net .

Page contents Estates Return Information Collection (ERIC) This is the main central data collection for estates and facilities services from the NHS containing information dating back to 1999/2000. Trusts enter data into the system which provides real time performance indicator information varying form on screen indicators to charts allowing organisations to benchmark their performance. Data from the ERIC collection is published on the NHS Digital website. Patient-led Assessments of the Care Environment (PLACE) This programme was established in 2013 and replaced the former Patient Environment Assessment Team (PEAT) programme which had run since 2000. PLACE is a voluntary self-assessment programme and is undertaken mostly by hospitals and hospices providing NHS-funded care in both the NHS and private / independent sectors, but other healthcare organisations are encouraged and supported to participate. PLACE assessments are an annual appraisal of the non-clinical aspects of NHS and independent/private healthcare settings, undertaken by teams comprising members of the public (\u2018patient assessors\u2019) and staff, with patient assessors making up at least 50 per cent of the team. The PLACE programme provides a framework for marking quality against common guidelines and standards to assess aspects of the healthcare environment, from the patients\u2019 point of view: -The physical condition and appearance of the environment and its fixtures and fittings; -The standard and of food and hydration provision; -How the care delivery supports users\u2019 privacy and dignity; -Whether the premises meet the needs of users with dementia; -Whether the premises meet the needs of users with a disability. See more information about the PLACE programme . Data from the PLACE collection is published on the NHS Digital website. Surplus Land The NHS Surplus Land collection has existed since 2008 to provide information to the Department of Health, the Homes and Communities Agency and the Government Property Unit on NHS sites that can be disposed of, thereby contributing to the Government Public Sector Land Disposal Programme. The emphasis is on land that is no longer required, nor likely in future to be needed for health service purposes. It includes declared market value of land and buildings sold during the financial year (any type of disposals which may result in housing or other types of development), and land retained to be redeveloped for NHS staff housing. Data from the NHS Surplus Land collection from 2015/16 onwards is published on the NHS Digital website. Non-Medical Equipment Defects and Failure Incident Reports This system was introduced to meet workplace regulations concerning the health, safety and welfare of the NHS workforce. It provides a picture of possible shortcomings with major equipment and helps identify trends in where and when failure can take place, giving additional support for risk management to ensure safety for both staff and patients in the NHS environment. It is a mandatory return to be used as needed by all NHS Trusts for the recording and investigation of incidents that involve or result in failures of non-medical equipment. The information is collated and reported on by the Department of Health as part of the stewardship of the healthcare system and to support the NHS Constitution pledge of a \u2018clean and safe environment that is fit for purpose, based on national best practice\u2019. It also supports the regulatory processes of organisations such as the Care Quality Commission (CQC), Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and the Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. Further information can be found here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reporting-of-defects-and-failures-and-disseminating-estates-and-facilities-alert Degree Days This is a measure of the average temperature, against which the energy used for space heating can be monitored. This module displays monthly and 20 year average data at 15 o C and 18.5 o C degrees. This is for information only. PLACE lite Participants in the PLACE programme are also able to make use of the PLACE-lite module on the EFM system. This allows healthcare providers to plan and conduct bespoke assessments throughout the year, focussing on the parts of the PLACE assessment that are locally most important and/or that require improvement e.g. to assess a new facility without waiting for the annual assessments. PLACE-lite is not monitored or reported on by NHS Digital. Organisations not eligible for the main PLACE programme can also use this module; to gain access please email placenotifications@nhs.net . EFPMS A comprehensive collection of estates and facilities data set up by Welsh Government to improve the management of NHS estate in Wales. For further information, please contact NHS Wales (details on the website below): http://www.nwssp.wales.nhs.uk/facilities-management How do I use the EFM-Information system? User guidance is available on the system itself. Who is it for? People in NHS trusts submitting data on the subjects above. Registered users can also see real time data, benchmark and run data reports within the system. It contains data from 1999/2000 onwards.

Page contents Background The NHS Surplus Land data collection has existed since 2008 and was originally designed to provide information to the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), Homes England and the Office of Government Property (OGP) on sites that can be disposed of, thereby contributing to the Public Land for Housing Programme . The collection currently monitors the contribution made by the NHS to the release of publicly owned land to ensure the efficient and strategic use of the NHS estate. From quarter 2 of 2020/21 onwards, reporting is done by data providers when needed in an always-live collection on the Estates and Management Facilities (EFM) system . The live collection combined and replaced previous information sources on surplus land in the NHS, including the Strategic Estates Planning (SLP) Collection and the annual NHS England Surplus Land collection. Merging these into a single live collection significantly reduced the burden on data providers and enables timely access to this data for stakeholders and for the public. Uses Examples of how NHS Surplus Land data is used and why it is important. DHSC use this data for: monitoring and informing activity internally, briefing ministers and senior civil servants, and informing departmental strategy informing wider strategic discussions and delivery on surplus land to ensure the right shape and size of the NHS estate financial reporting and planning, such as capital planning and spending reviews harnessing wider support and funding for disposals NHS England use this data for: monitoring and informing activity internally, briefing ministers and senior executives supporting, reviewing, and challenging estate strategies financial reporting and planning (including spending reviews) Regional authorities use this data for identifying where local support can help promote the most effective use of surplus land. Reporting responsibilities NHS trusts and NHS Property Services (reporting organisations) must update the collection regularly. The minimum requirement is that the latest information available is reported by the end of the quarter for extraction and publication. Information is required for plots that: have been disposed of since the start of the current financial year (for example, 1 April 2022). are currently surplus, or are a future opportunity for disposal Oversight and data assurance The following controls are in place to ensure data remains accurate and relevant: The collection system has input controls around data type and range, and blank values. Providers are not required to respond to questions irrelevant to their disposal (for example, they are not asked to provide sale details for an unsold site). NHS England senior estates leads (SELs) have access to data for their region (only) via delivery of a management information extract, so they can conduct focused checks on whether data matches their own understanding of the local context. NHS England\u2019s Programme Management Office (PMO) performs analysis of completeness and accuracy of data at regional/national level, checking data is consistent with alternatives source (such as NHS financial returns). They are responsible for highlighting to the relevant senior estates leads and regional delivery directors (RDDs) when further action is needed. Prior to publication, the NHS England Workforce and Estates Data Collection team conducts validation checks on the data extract for the quarter and will contact data providers and request that any inconsistencies are addressed. Roles and responsibilities Role Responsibilities Access level NHSE assurance leads (SELs and RDDs) Engaging data providers to monitor compliance with reporting requirements. Supporting data providers to complete returns by signposting to guidance, challenging data provided and troubleshooting.

Role-based access control via secure login - data for own organisation only Surplus Land data publication frequency The NHS Surplus Land collection was live throughout the year, to extract and publish information on a quarterly basis to improve transparency around NHS performance and activity. This placed no additional burden on trusts, and there was no requirement for extra resource. Trusts could update the information as and when they were able. From 2025/26 onwards, we will collect and publish the information biannually, at the end of quarter 2 and quarter 4, to improve data quality. All data for plots marked by providers as 'not sensitive' will be published by NHS England. It will be marked as 'not sensitive' when reported to cross-government programmes. Data for plots marked by providers as 'sensitive' will not be published by NHS England, although a small number of England-level aggregate figures will be released (it is not possible to identify any trust level figures from these). Data will only be shared for clearly justified purposes in line with the uses detailed above. Any shared data will be marked as 'sensitive' and must only be viewed by approved recipients.

Page contents It is a benchmarking tool to ensure improvements are made in the non-clinical aspects of patient care including environment, food, privacy and dignity. The assessment results help to highlight areas for improvement and share best practice across healthcare organisations in England. Results contribute to the Care Quality Commission's assessment of healthcare providers performance through their Quality and Risk Profiles (QRPs). How is PEAT assessed? PEAT is self assessed and provides an inspection framework to demonstrate how well individual healthcare organisations believe they are performing in key areas including: food cleanliness infection control patient environment (including bathroom areas, lighting, floors and patient areas) privacy and dignity What are the PEAT scores? Participating hospitals from both the NHS and Independent healthcare sector are each given scores from 1 (unacceptable) to 5 (excellent) for standards of environment, food and dignity and privacy within buildings. The scores demonstrate how well individual healthcare providers believe they are performing in the key areas (such as food, cleanliness, infection control, patient environment, privacy and dignity). Who is involved in PEAT assessments? Assessments are carried out by NHS staff, including nurses, matrons, doctors, catering and domestic service managers, executive and non-executive directors, dieticians and estates directors. Patients, patient representatives and members of the public are also part of this assessment process. Introduction of Patient-Led Inspections We are currently developing a new inspection programme for launch in April 2013. This aims to strengthen and formalise the role of patients in both the content of the assessment and the delivery of inspections. We are also taking the opportunity to review all aspects of the assessment and the supporting guidance with a view to producing more robust data and a more consistent approach.

Page contents Good environments matter. Every NHS patient should be cared for with compassion and dignity in a clean, safe environment. Where standards fall short, they should be able to draw it to the attention of managers and hold the service to account. PLACE assessments will provide motivation for improvement by providing a clear message, directly from patients, about how the environment or services might be enhanced. April 2013 saw the introduction of PLACE, which is the system for assessing the quality of the patient environment, replacing the old Patient Environment Action Team (PEAT) inspections. The assessments primarily apply to hospitals and hospices providing NHS-funded care in both the NHS and private/independent sectors but others are also encouraged and helped to participate in the programme. The PLACE collection underwent a national review, which started in 2018 and concluded in summer 2019. The question set has been significantly refined and revised, and guidance documents have been updated. The review ensures that the collection remains relevant and delivers its aims. As the changes have been extensive, it is important to note that the results of the 2019 assessments will not be comparable to earlier collections. We are making the assessment forms available now so that organisations may begin to review the changes. Further documentation including all guidance will be published soon, and data providers will be invited to a training webinar. Please do not attempt to undertake PLACE assessment until all materials are available and the assessment period has officially launched. The assessments involve local people (known as Patient Assessors) going into hospitals as part of teams to assess how the environment supports the provision of clinical care, assessing such things as privacy and dignity, food, cleanliness and general building maintenance and, more recently, the extent to which the environment is able to support the care of those with dementia. From 2016 the assessment will also look as aspects of the environment in relation to those with disabilities. Recruitment and training of patient assessors is the responsibility of those organisations undertaking assessments. The assessments take place every year, and results are published to help drive improvements in the care environment. The results show how hospitals are performing both nationally and in relation to other hospitals providing similar services. It should be noted however that the assessment focuses exclusively on the environment in which care is delivered and does not cover clinical care provision or how well staff are doing their job. PLACE assessment forms and supporting guidance documents The PLACE assessment forms and supporting guidance documents are available to download below. These will enable those undertaking assessments to prepare themselves and to provide local training to patient and staff assessors. The documents include both the assessment forms and a variety of guidance material on recruiting and training patient assessors. They also include local training materials and guidance for anyone wishing to become a patient assessor. The collection and supporting assessment documents have been approved by the Standardisation Committee on Care Information (SCCI) - SCCI2085). Want to be a patient assessor? The assessments give patients and the public a voice that can be in the drive to give people more influence over the way their local health and care services are run and in the way in which they are held to account. Assessment teams are a collaboration between staff and patient assessors, with Patient Assessors making up at least 50 per cent of the assessment team. Anyone who uses the service can be a Patient Assessor, including current patients, their family and visitors, carers, patient advocates or patient council members. NHS Foundation Trust Governors can also be Patient Assessors. Staff working in a hospital cannot undertake assessments there as Patient Assessors, though they are able to act as Patient Assessors at hospitals in other NHS Trusts or elsewhere. Similarly those who have recently left employment in a hospital/Trust should not return as a Patient Assessor until a suitable period (normally two years) has elapsed. If you are interested in becoming a patient assessor, please contact your local Healthwatch group or your local NHS Trust's Volunteer Coordinator.

      "content": "Patient-led assessments of the care environment dementia-friendly environments: guidance for assessors This guidance has been introduced to help assessors (both patients and staff) taking part in patient-led assessments of the care environment (PLACE) to understand the reasons for the questions asked in the dementia-friendly section. The guidance should help assessors make more consistent decisions during the assessment. Page contents Dementia is an umbrella term used to describe a range of symptoms that people experience when the brain is affected by certain diseases or conditions. Research shows there are more than 850,000 people in the UK who have dementia. One in 14 people over the age of 65 have dementia and the condition affects 1 in 6 people over 80. The number of people with dementia is increasing because people are living longer. It is estimated that by 2025, the number of people with dementia in the UK will be more than 1 million. It is therefore important that healthcare premises are designed in a less alienating way for people with dementia, creating a safe and secure environment for them to move around. Types of dementia According to Age UK, there are over 100 types of dementia, although they do not all have the same symptoms or combination of symptoms. Dementia symptoms may include problems with: memory loss thinking speed mental sharpness and quickness language, such as using words incorrectly, or trouble speaking understanding judgement mood movement difficulties doing daily activities Why does PLACE include questions on dementia and the environment? While there are many types of dementia, they often have things in common such as memory loss, difficulty learning and retaining new information, cognitive functions including visual and spatial abilities getting worse than they would normally be expected to with age, and confusion. People with dementia may find it difficult to see things if they are the same colour as the background, for example handrails that are the same colour as the wall. Highly polished floors can look wet and slippery, and shadows may be misinterpreted as a change in floor level. Everyday things that were familiar may become unfamiliar. Seeing something such as a toilet and remembering what it is for can become two unconnected processes which do not necessarily work together. These things and the other ways that dementia can affect a person mean that \u2018normal\u2019 environments can become difficult, confusing, or unsafe places. There are things which can be done, or not done, to reduce this. The questions in the assessment try to assess what is in place to help make the environment more dementia friendly. It should be noted that patients with dementia can be in hospital for clinical issues directly related to their dementia, but also owing to issues not related to their dementia. This should therefore be considered as part of the assessments. What are the aims of the dementia-friendly environment questions The questions in PLACE are designed to assess how well the healthcare setting already supports people with dementia, and what needs to improve to help them stay as independent as possible for as long as possible. Without the right things the environment could contribute to people being and feeling less safe, more confused or anxious or less independent. There are some simple things that help, such as keeping things consistent, for example all toilet doors being painted in yellow; or all signs being the same size and colour and having the same type of lettering. It is generally accepted that if you improve the environment for those with dementia you will probably improve it for others and will not do anything that has a negative impact. The correct answer to the question in the assessment should usually be obvious and unambiguous. However, these conflicting needs or recommendations do mean that an organisation sometimes has to make decisions based on their judgement of what is in the best interest of the majority of patients. What aspects of the environment does PLACE look at The questions in the assessment look at a selection of the issues that can affect how dementia friendly an environment is. However, this is not a comprehensive/full assessment of all the issues, and it is recommended that organisations carry out a fuller assessment of their environment using a recognised toolkit. Flooring Good flooring supports stability, encourages safe walking and reduces falls. Poor flooring can cause injury, anxiety, loss of independence and increased reliance on staff. Getting it right is important. Put simply, a good floor looks and acts like a floor \u2013 and nothing else. Flooring should: not look like a step because of a sudden change of colour not look like an obstacle or barrier because there is a line or pattern across it, because this can make people hesitate or try to step over it not look like it might be wet (e.g., highly polished or reflective) because this might not register with a person with dementia not have a pattern which is busy or big. Patterns can make it look as if there are things that need to be picked up, pushed to one side or stepped over making a fall more likely. Contrast is important as a small pattern which contrasts is worse than a large pattern which is inconspicuous be clear where the floor ends, and the walls begin, by good colour contrast with skirting not be noisy to walk on and, ideally should absorb other noise For these reasons consistency, matt and non-reflective surfaces, size of patterns and contrast become important. Domestic style wood laminate effect flooring (e.g., oak effect colouring) can be used to create a less institutional feel. When assessing the flooring, PLACE assessors should think about whether it meets the criteria listed above. See also Appendix 1 for further advice and example pictures of acceptable/unacceptable flooring. Signage We all use signs to guide us through life. People with dementia, and particularly those entering a new environment are no different, but the impairments to their cognitive functions and decision-making abilities may mean that signs need to be much clearer. Consistency is very important. Signage should always be clear, visible, easily recognisable and have good colour contrast. Using both pictures and words is also important as people with dementia will lose cognitive function in different ways. Some will lose the ability to recognise words, while others may not be able to recognise pictures, so both are important. Signs should be fixed at a height that makes viewing easy (recommended height 4ft/1.21 metres) where possible or appropriate. Fixtures and fittings Making sure there is a good colour contrast between fixtures and the area around them is important. It makes it more likely that people with dementia can use them without help and be more independent. Having a white toilet with a white seat against a white background could make it very difficult for someone to know where to sit, or aim. Adding a coloured seat and contrasting hand rails is not usually difficult or expensive. Sometimes simple changes can make a big difference. You will need to use your judgement when assessing fixtures and fittings, but it is important to be accurate, and if you think something might cause confusion or be unfamiliar then you should say so in the assessment. It serves no-one\u2019s interests to take an over-positive approach and suggest things are better than they are. Strong patterns It is important to avoid things which send too much information to the brain this can be too much for the senses to cope with (sensory overload). So, strong patterns in wall coverings, bedding, curtains, etc, should be avoided. This kind of item can be replaced over time as items wear out naturally or areas require redecoration.

Colour There is a range of solutions that provide contrasting colours for flooring finishes. Bright colours should be avoided as they may not be clearly seen, but dark surfaces may require extra care in cleaning.

      "content": "Guidance and information for patient assessors This guidance sets out what a Patient-Led Assessment of the Care Environment Assessment (PLACE) is, the qualities and experience required to be a patient assessor, why you might want to join in and how to get involved. Page contents Good environments matter. A clean environment is the foundation for lower infection rates, while good food promotes recovery and improves the patient experience. High standards of privacy promote patient dignity. Good maintenance and furnishings support a safe and comfortable stay. But good environments don\u2019t just happen. Without the efforts of all staff, the benefits of cleanliness, good food, privacy and proper maintenance may be lost. Patient-Led Assessments of the Care Environment (PLACE) help organisations understand how well they are meeting the needs of their patients, and identify where improvements can be made. They take place across NHS trusts, voluntary, independent and private healthcare providers and use information gleaned directly from patient assessors to report how well a site/organisation is performing. PLACE is the only national assessment programme that collects data relating to the patient environment and the only process that provides a consistent approach so that all providers are assessing the same things to the same standards. PLACE helps organisations understand how well they are meeting the needs of their patients, and identify where improvements can be made. It is recommended that all NHS trusts, voluntary, independent and private healthcare providers undertake annual PLACE assessments of the quality of non-clinical services and condition of their buildings to look at: how clean the environments are the condition \u2013 inside and outside \u2013 of the building(s), fixtures and fittings how well the building meets the needs of those who use it, for example through signs and car parking facilities the quality and availability of food and drinks how well the environment protects people\u2019s privacy and dignity how well the environment supports people with dementia how well the environment supports people with a disability. The assessments apply to all healthcare site/premises of all types. This includes acute, specialist, children\u2019s, mental health, learning disabilities, community, voluntary, independent and private healthcare providers. All organisations and sites are eligible for inclusion in the programme regardless of size or bed numbers. However, the intention is to restrict inclusion of very small units which clearly do not meet the definition of a hospital. Therefore, where a unit has fewer than 10 beds, organisations will need to determine, based on their knowledge of the unit and the services provided, whether it could reasonably be classed as a hospital. For example, a 9-bedded unit called \u2018XXX Regional Eye Hospital\u2019 would meet the definition of a hospital, but a community-based home where assessment and treatment are not carried out would not. Any unit with 10 or more beds should be included in the assessment programme. For large sites/organisations, a minimum of 25% of wards or 10, whichever is the greater, should be assessed: Number of wards in the healthcare site Number of wards to be assessed 1-10 All 11 -40 10 41 or more 25% For non-ward areas a minimum of 25% should be included in the assessment. For specific areas such as outpatient departments this will be a relatively simple but for less specific areas assessing teams will need to apply a degree of discretion in deciding precisely how much to assess. Assessments are carried out every year by people who potentially use the building \u2013 patients, relatives, carers, friends, patient advocates, volunteers or trust/organisation membership and trust/organisation governors \u2013 supported by staff. The assessment will be organised by a member of staff known as the PLACE programme lead and each assessment will be led by a PLACE/team lead. Patients voice is critical in helping organisations deliver effective services in good care environments. The purpose of this document is to set out what qualities and experience are required to be a patient assessor, what carrying out PLACE assessments means, why you might want to join in, and how to get involved. Further guidance specific to your organisation will be provided locally. PLACE is an annual snapshot that gives organisations a clear picture of how their environment is seen by those using it, and how they can improve it. PLACE assessments only look at the buildings and related non-clinical services like catering. The quality of care and all the other things that go to make up a good experience are dealt with elsewhere, for example local Healthwatch\u2019s \u2018enter and view\u2019 assessments, or the Care Quality Commission\u2019s surveys and monitoring processes. Experience, knowledge and skills You don\u2019t need any specific knowledge of healthcare to take part in a PLACE assessment. However, there are a few things to think about before becoming a patient assessor, and these are set out below. This is to make sure that the process works as well as it can do for all concerned \u2013 the assessor, the patients, the staff and the organisation\u2019s management. Experience Some recent personal experience of in-patient care is useful, although it is not essential. This could be as a patient, relative, carer, friend, patient advocate, volunteer or trust/organisation membership and trust/organisation governor. You will be called a patient assessor even if you are not a patient yourself. You should not act as a patient assessor if you are employed (or have been employed within the last 2 years) by the organisation you are assessing. In this case you may be on the team as a staff assessor, or you may be a patient assessor for other organisations. Age is no barrier to being a patient assessor. It can be particularly helpful to have input from children and young people for paediatric areas. Older people make up the majority of the adult in-patient population, so should ideally be well-represented in the PLACE team. We would welcome a broad range of people to address the need to have diversity by focusing on recruiting patient assessors with protected characteristics. Knowledge Patient assessors do not require any technical expertise or knowledge. What you need is the ability to understand and apply simple guidance, together with a common-sense, unbiased and practical approach. Skills Patient assessors need to be able to gather information in a variety of ways, following a clearly defined checklist. You will need to be able to: communicate clearly with people listen actively and encourage people to talk about the site/building and its services be objective when assessing or gathering evidence participate in discussions present a point of view clearly but reasonably be open to the views of others contribute to a brief summary statement of what you saw Physical abilities Taking part in an assessment can be tiring. If you are not physically fit, the organisation should be able to make adjustments for this \u2013 for example, by involving you in just part of the assessment or by providing a wheelchair. Please raise any support needs with the assessor prior to the assessment so that arrangements can be put in place before the assessment. If you have a disability, there may be parts of the assessment you cannot contribute to, but this does not mean you cannot be involved. If you are partially-sighted, for instance, your input will be particularly helpful in assessing how easy it is to find your way around the building. Involvement How it works PLACE patient assessors are volunteers who are appointed by organisations such as the local Healthwatch or approached directly by the organisation being assessed. You may be asked to participate in one or more assessments. Assessments can last from 2 to 6 hours on any day, depending on the size of the site. In very large hospitals, an assessment might run over more than one day. You may be asked to carry out just part of an assessment. You will help the team to agree a score for a number of things including cleanliness, d\u00e9cor, the quality and taste of food, how the privacy and dignity of patients are provided for, and how the environment supports people with dementia or a disability. You will not be asked to make any judgements about how well clinical staff are doing their job, although if you see something that causes you concern you will be expected to draw attention to it either straight away or at the end of the assessment. You will reach your own views about the scores to be applied, and these will contribute to overall judgements that the team will make. You will be able to talk to the PLACE/team lead, who will explain how your work will fit into the wider assessment of the performance of the site. The key stages of an assessment are: planning for the assessment agreeing on the day who will do what undertaking the assessment discussing your findings with other team members completing the patient summary assessment sheet. The site/organisation will then send the results to NHS England. You will not be involved in this step. As a patient assessor, you will always be accompanied by a staff assessor while you are in the patient areas. You will have the chance to talk to other patient assessors on your own at the end of the assessment. Joining the assessment team Once you have agreed to be a patient assessor, the site/organisation will contact you before the planned date of the assessment. If you are not able to take part on that day you can say so, but once you have agreed to join the assessment you should make every effort to do so. Late withdrawal will cause inconvenience to others and may result in the assessment being postponed. Of course, if you have any symptoms of COVID-19 or other infectious illness (especially with vomiting and diarrhoea) then you should not attend. Please inform the PLACE programme lead as soon as possible in this situation. Regarding COVID-19, we expect organisations to facilitate your visit in a risk-managed way. All organisations will have developed policies to ensure the safety of all visitors to their site(s). Some may still require the wearing of masks, and all should provide for frequent hand washing. You should be made aware of all precautions in advance of attending on assessment day. Disclosure and Barring Service checks The Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) and the criminal records regime have been scaled back to more proportionate levels. While patient assessors may already have DBS checks (e.g. local Healthwatch members who undertake \u2018enter and view\u2019 activities), it is unlikely that DBS checks will be needed for the majority of patient assessors. However, the final decision on this rests with the organisation, which may choose to seek a standard DBS check. Patient assessors are not eligible for enhanced DBS checks. Things to do before the assessment The organisation should provide clear guidance on the timescales for PLACE assessors being trained that demonstrate best practice guidelines. Examples of best practice could be in the form of an induction recruitment that includes a role description, along with information on the team structure. The organisation should also provide you with a copy of the assessment forms and the guidance that goes with it. You can also download them from our PLACE collection webpage . You can read the guidance papers at home. This should not take more than 2 hours. If you have any questions, you should contact your PLACE programme lead. The papers tell you what you will be looking at and how the scoring system works. In general, you will work with other members of the team to decide on such things as whether something (for example a floor or toilet) is clean, or whether something is in good condition (such as furniture or decorations). Extra guidance will be provided to help you make these judgements. The trust/organisation or local patient organisation will provide training/preparation for all patient assessors, either on a date before the assessment, or on the actual day of the assessment. It is recommended that you attend the training/preparation, as it will give you the opportunity to meet the other staff and patient assessors, and learn about the process and what is expected of you on the day. Things to do on the day The first task will be to agree among yourselves within the assessment team which areas of the site you will be looking at. The PLACE/team lead will be able to help you, but where there is a choice (for example, if just a sample of wards is being assessed), the final decision should be discussed with you. For most sites, the team will split up into smaller teams to make sure everything is covered. One person in each team will be the PLACE/team lead, and they will record the final agreed scores for each area. You will have a staff assessor with you at all times. You will then visit the designated ward, department or other area, looking at each relevant item. You should make sure you see enough of each to get a clear picture, but you do not need to check every single item. All items included in the assessment framework and present in the area being assessed must be included. However, the notion of sampling is well established, and it is not necessary to look at every item in every area in order to determine the score to be awarded. You should take care not to disrupt the normal activity of the area, although you should be able to speak to staff and patients if you wish. Remember that the organisation is looking for your opinion. This is not a patient survey, so when you talk to patients, you should do so in order to form your own opinion. As a general rule, you should only ask patients about those things that you cannot judge for yourself. Take care not to disrupt the care of patients. Do not enter bedrooms or bathrooms without permission (unless they are empty) and do not ask patients personal questions about their medical condition or care. When speaking to patients always introduce yourself as part of an assessment team, stressing that you are there to represent the interests of current and future patients. Have your ID badge issued by the organisation with you at all times. You will need to follow instructions about what to do in an emergency, for instance if there is a fire, or a cardiac arrest. Sometimes, the team may need to break off an assessment and come back later, if there is a clinical emergency. Before you leave the area being assessed, the team will spend a few minutes agreeing the score(s) to be awarded before moving on. This means that if there are any disagreements you can return to the area or item and have another look. The PLACE/team lead should then complete just one form per ward/area on behalf of you all. This \u2018score as you go\u2019 approach means you should not need to write much down, but you may take notes if you wish. This will be useful where the team needs to make a note of the reason an item/area has failed to meet the agreed criteria. Assessing the food services You may be asked to taste the food and judge its quality. Every dish must be tasted by several people, but you do not need to taste each one yourself. For instance, if you are vegetarian, you would not want to taste the meat dishes, but it would be wrong to say they do not taste good. In this case, you would base your judgement solely on the vegetarian options. You should take care not to let any personal preferences overrule the general quality. For example, you may prefer white bread, but you would still be able to say whether a brown bread sandwich was fresh and well-prepared. Assessors should agree a joint score for each food item tasted, regardless of whether every assessor tasted every item. What to do if you see a problem During the assessment, you may see something that is not covered by PLACE, but that you want to draw attention to. Usually this is best done direct with the ward staff or Place/team lead. Although unlikely, it is possible that during a PLACE assessment you may see something which is of very serious concern. This may be something that should be acted on very quickly. For example, you may hear about or observe abuse or neglect. If this happens and if you feel this is something that should be reported beyond the management, you can contact the Care Quality Commission (CQC). To do this you should call the Care Quality Commission 0300 061 6161 number and select Option 2 for safeguarding. This will put you through to the safety escalation team. They will record your information and notify the relevant member of staff to deal with this, who may then contact you. The CQC ensures that when it receives safeguarding information it passes the information on in a timely manner to the local authority and/or the police. The role of the Care Quality Commission CQC is the independent regulator of all health and social care services in England. Its job is to make sure care provided by hospitals, dentists, ambulances, care homes and services in people\u2019s own homes and elsewhere meets essential standards of quality and safety. CQC puts the views, experiences, health and wellbeing of people who use services at the centre of its work, and has a range of powers it can use to take action if people are receiving poor care. After the assessment Some questions are specifically written for patient assessors only to answer. This is to make sure that the patient voice is strong and clear. At the end of the assessment, patient assessors will meet alone to answer the questions that relate only to you and complete a patient assessment summary sheet. The assessing team may complete more than one form (for example, if the assessment takes place over 2 days, with different teams assessing different areas, then each team may complete a form). Patient assessors will decide whether they want to complete individual forms or they may wish to complete a consolidated form together. You will need to discuss your answers, resolve any difficulties, and agree the wording of a short summary statement. It is unusual to find serious disagreements. You will need to agree among you which patient assessor will sign the patient assessment summary sheet on behalf of you all. The patient assessors will also make recommendations for improvement. Clearly, these must be reasonable and achievable. It would be unrealistic, for example, to suggest that the building needs to be completely rebuilt before the next assessment. Recommendations work best when they are specific and measurable. For example: provide a hot option with the evening meal replace bed curtains with longer ones / replace worn-out flooring in outpatients corridor After the assessment, you should hand your patient assessment summary sheet to the assessment manager. They will submit your comments along with the final results of the assessment through an online system. The patient assessment summary sheet also asks you to confirm that you feel the assessment has been handled properly and your views have been listened to. If you have any concerns, you should say so here. However, you can also contact NHS England\u2019s Workforce and Estates Statistics team at [email protected] . If you find you do need to get in touch, please state clearly the site/organisation where the assessment took place and be as clear as possible about what happened to make you need to write about it. Payment Organisations will usually cover travel expenses and/or provide free parking and refreshments. Organisations should follow their own local policies for reimbursement. Most organisations reimburse travel expenses and provide appropriate refreshments, whilst some also offer a small honorarium. For more information on remuneration of volunteers please contact your local PLACE programme lead for details on how your travel expenses will be reimbursed. Find further information about volunteer rights . Publication of results Once the results are submitted, they are analysed by NHS England. The organisation will receive the final results and will have a chance to plan its response to your suggestions. It will then publish the results and the improvement plan on their website. The national results are published by NHS England . How the information is used PLACE information is used by a range of public bodies including the CQC, NHS England, NHS Choices and the Department of Health and Social Care. It is aligned with, and supports other inspection, monitoring and performance regimes. For example, the data supports provider compliance with 5 of CQC\u2019s 16 essential standards of safety and quality, and feeds into CQC\u2019s intelligent monitoring. How to get involved Each organisation recruits its own patient assessors. This could be through the local Healthwatch, and as well as recruitment of patients from other sources (such as local patient charities). If you want to be involved, you should contact your local Healthwatch or patient involvement team. Alternatively, the volunteer co-ordinator at your local hospital should be able to help. The role of patient assessor is an important one. It needs people who can be objective and unbiased and who do not let themselves be side-tracked. It needs a clear commitment to quality and to viewing the environment in its widest sense. We would welcome a broad range of people to address the need to have diversity by focusing on recruiting patient assessors with protected characteristics. Most of all, it needs people who are determined to help the NHS to improve, and who are prepared to make their voices heard in a constructive and supportive way. At the end of the assessment, if there are any issues you did not feel were properly dealt with or that you were unable to reach an agreement on, you can report this by sending an email to [email protected] .

      "content": "Quality Accounts Page contents Quality Accounts are annual reports about the quality of services provided by an NHS healthcare service. They are published by each NHS healthcare provider, including the independent sector and are made available to the public. Links to the data for the fifteen mandatory indicators (and one non statutory indicator), based on recommendations by the National Quality Board, are set out below and also in the left hand navigation list to enable providers easy access to the latest data. They align closely with the NHS Outcomes Framework and are all based on data that trusts already report on nationally. The intention is that trusts will be required to report: their performance against these indicators; presented in a table format, for at least the last two reporting periods; the national average; and a supporting commentary, which may explain variation from the national average and any steps taken or planned to improve quality. The Quality Accounts are split down into the following 5 domains; Domain 1 - Preventing people from dying prematurely Domain 1 - Preventing people from dying prematurely Summary Hospital-level Mortality Indicator (SHMI) Patients on Care Programme Approach (CPA) followed up within 7 days of discharge from psychiatric inpatient stay Category A telephone calls (Red 1 and Red 2 calls) ; emergency response within 8 minutes Category A telephone calls; ambulance response within 19 minutes Patients with suspected ST elevation myocardial infarction who received an appropriate care bundle (Domain 1 and 3) Patients with suspected stroke assessed face to face who received an appropriate care bundle (Domain 1 and 3) Domain 2 - Enhancing quality of life for people with long-term conditions Domain 2 - Enhancing quality of life for people with long-term conditions Admissions to acute wards where the Crisis Resolution Home Treatment Team were gate keepers Domain 3 - Helping people to recover from episodes of ill health or following injury Domain 3 - Helping people to recover from episodes of ill health or following injury PROMS; patient reported outcome measures Patients readmitted to a hospital within 28 days of being discharged Domain 4 - Ensuring people have a positive experience of care Domain 4 - Ensuring people have a positive experience of care Responsiveness to the personal needs of patients Staff who would recommend the trust to their family or friends Patients who would recommend the trust to their family or friends Patient experience of community mental health services Domain 5 - Treating and caring for people in a safe environment and protecting them from avoidable harm Domain 5 - Treating and caring for people in a safe environment and protecting them from avoidable harm Patients admitted to hospital who were risk assessed for venous thromboembolism Rate of C.difficile infection Patient safety incidents and the percentage that resulted in severe harm or death Last edited: 24 April 2018 9:07 am",

      "content": "Domain 1 - Preventing people from dying prematurely Page contents Domain 1 - Preventing people from dying prematurely Links correct as of March 2019 Summary Hospital-level Mortality Indicator (SHMI) The Summary Hospital-level Mortality Indicator (SHMI) reports on mortality at trust level across the NHS in England. The SHMI is the ratio between the actual number of patients who die following hospitalisation at the trust and the number that would be expected to die on the basis of average England figures, given the characteristics of the patients treated there. It covers patients admitted to non-specialist acute trusts in England who died either while in hospital or within 30 days of discharge. SHMI values for each trust are published along with bandings indicating whether a trust's SHMI is '1 - higher than expected', '2 - as expected' or '3 - lower than expected'. For any given number of expected deaths, a range of observed deaths is considered to be 'as expected'. If the observed number of deaths falls outside of this range, the trust in question is considered to have a higher or lower SHMI than expected. The SHMI value and SHMI banding for each trust can be found in the ' SHMI data at trust level ' file. Trusts may be located at multiple sites and may be responsible for one or more hospitals. A breakdown of the data by site of treatment is also available from this page. The SHMI methodology does not make any adjustment for patients who are recorded as receiving palliative care. This is because there is considerable variation between trusts in the coding of palliative care. However, in order to support the interpretation of the SHMI, various contextual indicators are published alongside it, including indicators on the topic of palliative care coding. The percentage of deaths with palliative care coded at either diagnosis or specialty level for each trust can be found in the ' Percentage of deaths with palliative care coding ' file. Historic SHMI and contextual indicator data is also available . Guidance on how to accurately describe and interpret the SHMI is available to download from the SHMI homepage and trusts are strongly advised to consult the document 'SHMI interpretation guidance' prior to completing their Quality Account. The England average SHMI is 1.0 by definition, and this corresponds to a SHMI banding of 'as expected'. For the SHMI, a comparison should not be made with the highest and lowest trust level SHMIs because the SHMI cannot be used to directly compare mortality outcomes between trusts and, in particular, it is inappropriate to rank trusts according to their SHMI . Trusts are advised to use the banding descriptions i.e. 'higher than expected', 'as expected', or 'lower than expected' in their Quality Account rather than the numerical codes which correspond to these bandings. This is because, on their own, the numerical codes are not meaningful and cannot be readily understood by readers. Where trusts include other mortality indicators e.g. HSMR or RAMI in their Quality Account it is advised that some explanation of the main differences between these and the SHMI is provided to assist users. Also, if trusts use sources of SHMI data in addition to NHS Digital's SHMI publication, the data source should be stated.

If you are looking for advice about your own health or pregnancy, the NHS website provides guidance to the public on trying for a baby, pregnancy, labour and birth . Introduction and navigation The Maternity Services Data Set (MSDS) is a patient-level data set that captures information about activity carried out by Maternity Services relating to mothers and babies, from the point of the first booking appointment until mother and baby/babies are discharged from maternity services. The MSDS data and guidance section contains links to reports, data files, and dashboards, which contain MSDS data. As well as accompanying guidance and help pages. The More maternity & neonatal data section contains links to non-MSDS sources of maternity and neonatal data. These include reports, dashboards, and accompanying guidance. The Useful links section will direct you to other useful sources of information about maternity and neonatal services and care. The links with padlock icons are usually to communities and workspaces within the FutureNHS collaboration platform , and you will need a FutureNHS or NHS Mail account to access them.

      "content": "Practice Level Prescribing in England: a summary Practice level prescribing data is a list of all medicines, dressings and appliances that are prescribed by all practices in England, including GP practices, each month. Find practice level prescribing data Note - all PLP files are here but may not display in date order Summary Practice level prescribing data is released on the 24th of the month or the first working day afterwards. For example September 2018 data will be published on Monday 26 November 2018. For each practice in England, the following prescription information is presented at presentation level for each medicine, dressing and appliance that has been subsequently dispensed in the community in the UK: the total number of items prescribed and dispensed the total net ingredient cost the total actual cost the total quantity (in terms of number of tablets or millilitres, for example) The data does not cover practices in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. Presentation level means data is provided at the level of each individual drug name, form and strength or size. It does not list each individual prescription and doesn't contain any patient identifiable data. This data is published and made available under the Open Government Licence as part of the government's commitment to transparency . The data comes from NHS Prescription Services, part of the NHS Business Services Authority (BSA) . Practice level prescribing data is obtained from the BSA's prescribing and dispensing information systems. For each month there are three files: Practice Prescribing Data file - this is the main data file giving the practice level prescribing data at presentation level using the full 15 digit BNF code. GP prescribing chemical substance file - this gives the chemical substance or section as appropriate using the 9 digit (Drugs) or 4 digit (Appliances) BNF code. GP prescribing practice address file - this gives the practice name and address. Practice prescribing data requires careful interpretation, and the information should not be looked at in isolation. Access the data - warning: large file size Each month a file of practice level prescribing data is made available in CSV format. The monthly data set is large (over 10 million rows and over 1GB of data). Due to the large size standard spreadsheet applications may not be able to handle the volumes of data contained in the monthly datasets. The data can be viewed using add-ons to existing software, such as the Microsoft PowerPivot add-on for Excel , to handle larger data sets, can be used. Once PowerPivot has been installed, to load the large files, please follow the instructions below. Note that it may take at least 20 to 30 minutes to load one monthly file. Start Excel as normal Click on the PowerPivot tab Click on the PowerPivot Window icon (top left) In the PowerPivot Window, click on the \"From Other Sources\" icon In the Table Import Wizard scroll to the bottom and select Text File Browse to the file you want to open and choose the file extension you require, such as CSV Once the data has been imported you can view it in a spreadsheet. Date ranges available Since September 2012 prescribing data by GP practices was made available at two levels of detail: Presentation level, a more granular level first published in September 2012, covering data from August 2010, Released on the first Friday of the month. Chemical level, first published in December 2011, covering data from June 2010 and was stopped on April 5th 2013 with the publication of data for December 2012. Chemical level data can be derived from the more granular presentation-level data by GP practice which continues to be published. internal Practice level prescribing - glossary of terms A detailed description of the terms used in this data set. internal Practice level prescribing data: more information Describes which practices and professionals are included in the data and how prescription data is collected.",

      "content": "Practice level prescribing data: more information Describes which practices and professionals are included in the data and how prescription data is collected. Page contents Included practices All registered practices, including GP practices, in England are included in the data, including a number of 'dummy' practices. These are created by CCGs or NHS England (previously PCTs or Area Teams) to identify prescribing in environments or circumstances outside of a general practice, such as specialist clinics, hospices, prisons, out of hours services and training units. Prescriptions issued from a branch surgery are included in the totals for the main practice site. Data is provided at the general practice level, so the prescribing patterns of individual prescribers is not available. The number of practices can vary from month to month because: practices may close and others may open practices may merge or divide into smaller practices, appearing to alter the number of practices in an area Practices are identified only by their unique national code, so an additional data file - linked to the first by the practice code - provides further detail in relation to the practice. This: allows the data to be linked to other datasets that use the same national practice codes avoids potential confusion over practices that have similar names reduces the size of the prescription data file avoids duplication of practice name and address information throughout the file Presentations are identified only by their British National Formulary (BNF) code, so an additional data file - linked to the first by the BNF code - provides the chemical name for that presentation. What the data set can't tell you You can't: download data for only one practice or subset of practices - the data is contained in a single large data file compare one practice with another without further information about prescribing, list sizes, age and gender of patients on the list, knowledge about the medicines and why they are prescribed identify individual patients, even those receiving medication for rare conditions, because no patient data is contained in the data find out how many people with a particular condition have been given prescriptions - prescriptions given to patients do not say why the drug has been prescribed find out which pharmacies dispensed these prescriptions find out about private prescrptions - these are not included in the data find out the proportion of prescriptions that were paid for by patients or exempt from payment With this data set alone it is not possible to work out the prescribing rate - the percentage of patients receiving prescriptions. You would need additional data on the number of patients registered with a practice which can be found on the NHS Business Services Authority website . Included prescriptions The data covers NHS prescriptions written in England which have been dispensed in the community in the UK. This data was obtained from NHS Prescription Services, part of the NHS Business Services Authority (BSA) prescribing and dispensing information systems. The data includes prescriptions written by GPs and other non-medical prescribers (such as nurses, pharmacists, optometrists, chiropodists and potentially radiographers) who are attached to practices. The data does not cover private prescriptions. Where prescribing cannot be linked to a practice the data is excluded. This amounts to approximately 0.2 per cent of dispensed items. Only where a prescription has been dispensed is it included in the dataset. This is recorded when the dispensing contractor (usually a pharmacist) submits a claim for payment to the NHS Prescription Service. If an item has not been prescribed that month no record will exist. The NHS Prescription Services information system (the source of the practice level prescribing data) uses the therapeutic classifications defined in the British National Formulary (BNF). NHS Prescription Services has created 'pseudo BNF chapters' for items not included in BNF chapters 1 to 15. The majority of such items are dressings and appliances, (numbered 18 to 23). Note that there is no chapter 16 or 17. NHS Prescription Services has produced a booklet on BNF classifications and the pseudo classifications used . Data released Each month 3 files data files are released (2 months following the dispensing date). Monthly data is available from August 2010 to date. Similar prescribing data is available by quarter or by year, but at PCT, CCG and England level. View the quarterly PCT level prescribing data View the quarterly CCG level prescribing data View the annual Prescription Cost Analysis (PCA) prescribing data As well as practice level data, PCT and CCG data sets include prescribing that cannot be attributed to specific practices and CCGs respectively. PCA data also includes dentists and all hospital prescriptions dispensed in the community where these prescriptions were dispensed in England (including prescriptions written in the three other UK countries).

Page contents BNF classifications The NHS Business Services Authority (BSA) prescribing and dispensing information systems use the therapeutic classifications defined in the British National Formulary (BNF) as extended by the BSA. The same drug may appear in different areas of the BNF as it can be prescribed to treat more than one condition. For example, aspirin is licensed for use as an antiplatelet and as an analgesic. NHS Prescription Services have created pseudo BNF chapters for items not included in BNF chapters 1 to 15. The majority of such items are dressings and appliances, which have been classified into 4 pseudo BNF chapters (20 to 23). Chapters 18 and 19 include preparations used in diagnosis, and 'other preparations'. There is no chapter 16 or 17. NHS Prescription Services have produced a booklet on BNF classifications and the pseudo classifications used. The BNF is updated in March and September each year. NHS Prescription Services update their BNF classifications annually. While the therapeutic classification of drugs occasionally changes, all practice level publications reflect the classification in use at the time of publication. The primary purpose of the BNF is to provide information for clinicians. The format of the BNF was changed with Edition 70 (September 2015 to March 2016) making it more user friendly. However, the BSA, who process dispensed prescription forms, collect dispensed prescribing data and produce the ePACT data, continue to use the old BNF classification system to code medicines, which has become widely used in the UK as a classification to allow comparisons between drug groups. For example, it is used to report cost and trend in medicines use and supports several NHS Digital official publications. The data is used in many NHS IT systems. BNF code structure This is the BNF code for the drug: characters 1 and 2 show the BNF chapter 3 and 4 show the BNF section 5 and 6 show the BNF paragraph 7 shows the BNF sub-paragraph 8 and 9 show the chemical substance 10 and 11 show the product 12 and13 show the strength and formulation 14 and 15 show the equivalent The 'equivalent' is defined as follows: if the presentation is a generic, the 14th and 15th characters will be the same as the 12th and 13th character where the product is a brand, the 14th and 15th digit will match that of the generic equivalent, unless the brand does not have a generic equivalent in which case A0 will be used BNF name The drug is shown by individual preparation name, which may be proprietary or generic, followed by form and strength. The names used are often presented in an abbreviated form due to the limited number of characters available in the BSA Drug and Appliance database. Note that this field is limited to 40 characters in this file, so some names may have been cut short, compared with descriptions used elsewhere, for example the Prescription Cost Analysis figures published by NHS Digital. SHA/AT For data covering August 2010 to March 2013, this is code of the Strategic Health Authority (SHA) in which the practice resides. Following changes to the structure of the NHS, from April 2013 this field relates to the Area Team. Please note that prescription data may be attributed to organisations which have since closed. Prescriptions can be presented for dispensing up to 6 months after issue, so an issuing organisation may have closed before a prescription is dispensed. Prescription Services of the NHS Business Services Authority may also receive scripts late from an organisation or a prescription pad from a closed organisation may still be in use by a prescriber previously at that organisation. Therefore, it is possible that SHA codes will appear in data from April 2013 onwards. PCT/CCG For data covering August 2010 to March 2013, this is code of the Primary Care Trust (PCT) in which the practice resides. Note that for a small number of PCTs, Prescription Services do not use the same codes for care trusts as Organisation Data Services (ODS). The codes this affects are shown below. Prescription Services code ODS code Name 5ZT TAP Blackburn with Darwen 5ZU TAN North East Lincolnshire 5ZW TAL Torbay 5ZX TAK Bexley 5ZZ TAC Northumberland Following changes to the structure of the NHS, from April 2013 this field relates to the Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG). As with the SHA field, please note that prescription data may be attributed to organisations which have since closed. Prescriptions can be presented for dispensing up to 6 months after issue, so an issuing organisation may have closed before a prescription is dispensed. Prescription Services of the NHS Business Services Authority may also receive scripts late from an organisation or a prescription pad from a closed organisation may still be in use by a prescriber previously at that organisation. Therefore, it is possible that PCT codes will appear in data from April 2013 onwards. It should also be noted that following the NHS reforms in April 2013, PCTs were replaced with 211 CCGs. In addition, over 150 other 'cost centres', including trusts, councils and private company providers now exist. These 'cost centres' (the HSCIC refers to these as Non-CCG cost centres) are not linked to CCGs but are funded directly by Area Teams. Non-CCG cost centre prescribing is included in the Practice Presentation Level prescribing data. Whilst PCTs used to be responsible for all prescribing activity in their area, their replacements, CCGs, are not. Prescribing activity not recorded against a CCG will be recorded against the responsible non-CCG cost centre body. The non-CCG cost centre bodies are listed alongside the CCGs and are linked to the responsible Area Team above. For example, prescribing activity from a PCT will not be completely comparable with the activity of the replacement CCG(s) as some of the former PCT prescribing activity will now be recorded under a new, non-CCG body. At the Area Team level, all prescribing activity in an area will be recorded as either a CCG or non-CCG body. Practice Code and names This is code for the practice. It can potentially be used to linked to other data that uses the practice code as is defined by the NHS Digital Organisation Data Service (ODS) . The format is Axxxxx where \"A\" is a letter and \"xxxxx\" is a 5 digit number. Accompanying the release of the prescribing data is a file giving the name and address of each practice indexed by this code. The practice name and first line of the address are often the same. Where a practice does not supply a practice name the first line of the address is used. This file is arranged so the final column is usually the postcode even if this requires other parts of the address to be repeated or left blank to achieve this. Items This gives the number of items for this presentation that were dispensed in the specified month. A prescription item refers to a single supply of a medicine, dressing or appliance prescribed on a prescription form. If a prescription form includes three medicines it is counted as three prescription items. Item figures do not provide any indication of the length of treatment or quantity of medicine prescribed (the quantity is given in the 'Quantity' field, described below). Patients with a long term condition usually get regular prescriptions. Whilst many prescriptions are for one month, 28 or 30 days supply, others will be for various lengths of treatment and quantity. Net ingredient cost (NIC) This is the basic cost of a drug as used in primary care. This is the cost at list price excluding VAT, i.e. the price listed in the national Drug Tariff or in standard price lists and is not necessarily the price the NHS paid. It does not take into account of any contract prices or discounts, dispensing costs, fees or prescription charge income, so the amount the NHS paid will be different. NIC is used in Prescription Services reports and other analyses, as it standardises cost throughout prescribing nationally, and allows comparisons of data from different sources. The figures are in pounds and pence. Actual Cost From July 2012 onwards, the formula used to calculate 'Actual Cost' has been changed to include the new reimbursement payments which will be charged back to practices from dispensed prescriptions. The current formula is: the NIC less discount plus payment for consumables (previously known as Container Allowance) plus payment for Containers plus Out of Pocket expenses Prior to July 2012, this Actual Cost was defined as the NIC less the average discount percentage received by pharmacists calculated from the previous month, plus container allowance. This is the estimated cost to the NHS, which is lower than NIC. Community pharmacists are reimbursed for medicines they have dispensed on the basis of the NIC less a deduction related to the discount that they are assumed to have received from their suppliers (for details see the Drug Tariff Part V - Deduction Scale). A container allowance is then added (see Drug Tariff Part IV). The figures are in pounds and pence. Note: electronic Drug Tariff can be found at: https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/pharmacies-gp-practices-and-appliance-contractors/drug-tariff Quantity The quantity of a drug dispensed is measured in units depending on the formulation of the product, which is given in the drug name. Quantities should not be added together across preparations because of different strengths and formulations. where the formulation is tablet, capsule, ampoule, vial etc the quantity will be the number of tablets, capsules, ampoules, vials etc where the formulation is a liquid the quantity will be the number of millilitres where the formulation is a solid form (such as cream, gel, ointment) the quantity will be the number of grammes Processing date The date is given as the year and month to which the file refers. For example, June 2012 would be 201206. This date relates to the month in which the prescriptions were dispensed. Chemical name This is the International Non-proprietary Name (INN) and is the standard registered name for the active constituent of that medicine, for example omeprazole. For compounds the name may be more complex, such as co-magaldrox magnesium/aluminium hydrox). In some cases the name is a collective one for a range of medicines, such as alginic acid compound preparations. For prescriptions in BNF chapters 19 to 23, there is no \"chemical\" name, as these are dressings and appliances. Therefore, these items are reported under the BNF section name, for example, night drainage bags. Accuracy All prescription statistics in this data are based on information systems at NHS Prescription Services, part of the NHS BSA. The figures used are collected as an essential part of the process of reimbursing dispensers (mainly pharmacists and dispensing doctors) for medicines supplied. All prescriptions which are dispensed in England need to be submitted to NHS BSA if the dispenser is to be reimbursed and so coverage should be complete. NHS Prescription Services quality assures the data they provide. They state that due to the complex and manual processes involved there may be inaccuracies in capturing prescription information which are then reflected in the data. Currently the prescription processing activity is internally audited to 97.5% accuracy (meaning at least 97.5% of prescriptions are recorded accurately). While the BSA can adjust payments to dispensers if an error is identified they are unable to correct the prescribing data. Unidentified prescribing This is prescribing which cannot be allocated to a specific practice, and is not included in this data. Last edited: 2 November 2018 3:21 pm",

Dr Joe Rafferty Director of Commissioning Support Introducing the Commissioning Support National Team The Commissioning Support Team is part of the Commissioning Development Directorate at the NHS Commissioning Board Authority, reporting to National Director of Commissioning Development Dame Barbara Hakin, and based at both Skipton House in London and Quarry House in Leeds. The team members are: Director of Commissioning Support \u2013 Dr Joe Rafferty Deputy Director of Commissioning Support \u2013 Liz Bowsher Programme Office Director \u2013 Jill Peters Programme Director, Leadership Development and Organisational Design \u2013 Andrew Reynolds Programme Director, Procurement \u2013 Justin Rudwell Programme Director, Business Intelligence \u2013 Ming Tang Programme Director, Assurance \u2013 Andy Watson Finance Lead \u2013 Chris Butler People Transformation Lead \u2013 Graham Charsley Stakeholder Lead \u2013 Dr Louise Edwards Commissioning Support Policy \u2013 Philip Walker Programme Office \u2013 Pauline Pearce Project Support \u2013 Suzanne Ensor Office Support \u2013 Irene Schwehla and Rebecca Danby If you wish to contact the team, please email commissioningsupport@dh.gsi.gov.uk Recruitment of managing directors for CSSs The NHS Commissioning Board Authority has written to SHAs to ask them to nominate those people in \u2018Very Senior Manager\u2019 positions who wish to apply to be commissioning support service (CSS) managing directors. These candidates will be offered the opportunity to participate in a selection process starting in early May. Leaders of the 20-25 CSSs are being recruited to the same timetable as other NHS Commissioning Board senior roles, and are likely to be appointed from June 2012. The appointments will be made by a panel chaired by Dame Barbara Hakin, National Managing Director for Commissioning Development at the Board Authority, as the CSSs will be hosted by the Board Authority for up to three years. Checkpoint 2 panels get underway The panel meetings for the second stage of the commissioning support business review and assurance process \u2013 \u2018Checkpoint 2\u2019 \u2013 are underway. The series of 26 panels, which are taking place in Leeds and London, began on 23 April and will conclude on 4 May. The national moderation day, involving all panel chairs and other members of the NHS Commissioning Board Authority, will be on 8 May and the final decisions will be presented to the Board Authority\u2019s board meeting on 31 May. The panels cover the 25 NHS CSSs and the national communications and engagement CSS. Each panel will involve: A representative of the Board Authority who will chair the panel An emerging CCG leader An SHA director of commissioning development or a representative An independent business person. Panel members will receive a pack which includes the CSS prospectus, outline business plan, financial template, summary analysis from the Business Development Unit at the Board Authority, financial analysis from external accountants, and results of the emerging CCG and CSS surveys from NHS Clinical Commissioners. Members will also have a chance to hear the local \u2018soft\u2019 intelligence from the SHA in advance of the panel meeting. The tone of the day will be that of \u2018critical friend\u2019, and the approach will be developmentally focused. Each panel will need to agree a set of development areas to be included in the development plan following Checkpoint 2. The emerging CCG survey resulted in a 65 per cent response rate, with 141 emerging CCGs taking part. All 25 CSSs took part in the CSS survey. The results will be published as part of the papers for the Board Authority\u2019s board meeting in May. New \u2018simulation\u2019 case study being developed The first real-time commissioning support simulation exercise is being run on 17 May 2012 and will involve six emerging CCGs and four CSSs. The event, which is being organised by the NHS Commissioning Board Authority with the Health Services Management Centre at the University of Birmingham, and NHS Clinical Commissioners, aims to create a realistic environment in which participants, through role play, explore the ways that emerging CCGs will work with CSSs to commission effectively from their providers. The emerging CCGs and CSSs have been invited to reflect a range of sizes, locations and stages of development and include: CCGs in Bristol, Cheshire, Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, Enfield, Mid-Sussex and Horsham, and South of Tees CSSs in North West London, East Midlands, and Southampton, Hampshire, Isle of Wight and Portsmouth; plus a team of independent sector commissioning support service providers. The outputs of the day, which are expected to include lessons for both emerging CCGs and CSSs, will be made available on the Board Authority\u2019s website following the event. New \u2018informed customer\u2019 events \u2013 ask CCGs to sign up PCT and CSS colleagues are being asked to promote the importance of the \u2018informed customer\u2019 workshops with emerging CCG leaders. The workshops have been set up for 29 May in London and 7 June in Leeds , and the programme and booking are available online. Emerging CCGs need to be able to act as \u2018informed customers\u2019 who understand what they want, know how to procure it, and understand how to manage their support activities. The events will cover: An update on the latest developments in commissioning support Feedback from emerging CCGs including the recent national survey Feedback on the findings of the 17 May simulation event Key issues and considerations for emerging CCGs on procuring CSS resources Practical steps to help emerging CCGs plan their services. Podcasts of the case study presentations from the first event held in Birmingham in early March are available: Cheshire, Warrington and Wirral commissioning support Staffordshire commissioning support service The events are being run by NHS Clinical Commissioners and Primary Care Commissioning on behalf of the NHS Commissioning Board Authority. Additional tests for CSSs which provide national \u2018at scale\u2019 offers CSSs which plan to offer business intelligence, healthcare (clinical) procurement and business support components to their customers will be subject to additional tests in May and June 2012, following the Checkpoint 2 assurance process. These CSSs have already set out their working assumptions for these components within their outline business plans. The tests will focus on: The CSSs ability to deliver against defined standards (currently under development by the CSSs and the NHS Commissioning Board Authority) Making sure the cost structure is appropriate and sustainable Making sure there is the capability to deliver good quality and the right expertise across an appropriate scale to customers. The high level criteria have been circulated and the detailed assessment criteria will be published soon. By 31 May each CSS will be asked to submit detailed proposals for the scale services it wishes to provide. By the end of June, the Business Development Unit at the Board Authority will have reviewed the CSS submissions and identified the final configuration and development plans. The three national \u2018at scale\u2019 offers cover: Business intelligence Integration centres that provide data validation, integration and storage. The role of these centres is to cleanse, validate and link national and local data sets according to local rules and requirements, to provide meaningful conformed data for further analysis. Healthcare (clinical) procurement Market management activities such as market engagement, market analysis and market development. Procurement strategy/activities such as procurement project management, strategy development and technical advice/compliance. Aligned activities such as service specification development, negotiation support and contract management. Business support services HR, payroll, procurement of goods and services, and informatics. Integrated finance and accounting system The NHS Commissioning Board Authority has signed a contract between the NHS Commissioning Board (NHS CB) and NHS Shared Business Services (SBS) to provide an integrated finance and accounting system to the NHS CB from October 2012 and CCGs from April 2013. The use of the common system has been agreed to ensure proper financial and corporate governance, financial consistency, proper risk management relating to the transfer of financial information and the adoption of best practice in business processes. The integrated system will create a basic common infrastructure which will also be cost-effective and save time for organisations in terms of development. The SBS solution is already the most widely used finance and accounting system in the NHS by both commissioners and providers. The NHS CB will meet the contract costs in full and does not intend to recharge CCGs. It will be one of the requirements of the authorisation process that CCGs use the integrated system. The decision has been approved by the Cabinet Office as being good value for money and in keeping with the strategy for \u2018back office\u2019 functions. New ready reckoner with service lines in development An upgraded version of the ready reckoner \u2013 which models how emerging CCGs plan to spend their running costs \u2013 will be released in May. It will include around 30 service lines which are being developed to describe CSSs in a consistent way. News in brief Clinical commissioning group authorisation: Draft guide for applicants has been published following its formal ratification at the Board meeting of the NHS Commissioning Board Authority on 13 April 2012. The guide is still formally a \u2018draft\u2019 because the authorisation regulations have yet to be passed by Parliament. As such, the final version is scheduled to be published in October 2012 once the NHS Commissioning Board is established. However, emerging CCGs should use this document as the basis for their authorisation applications. The NHS Commissioning Board Authority and Department of Health are planning to ask PCTs for details of their 2011-12 spend, focused principally on future CCG and NHS Commissioning Board responsibilities. This will provide a view of current spending arrangements and help the Board Authority to plan CCG and NHS Commissioning Board responsibilities for 2013-14. PCTs will be asked to involve emerging CCG finance leads in discussions about these returns. Comments on this page are now closed. Share: Tweet",

The aim of the Framework is to help commissioners understand when competition could be used as an effective way to help achieve the best outcomes for patients. The Framework aims to support the requirement of commissioners as set out in the Health and Social Care Act 2012 to ensure good practice and to promote and protect patient choice. Competition is one of the many tools that commissioners may decide to use to improve services for patients. The content of the Framework will evolve as part of on-going discussion with commissioners to understand what tools they would find most useful. The Framework will be an easy to access suite of inter-related online products, including guidance, interactive tools, case studies and latest news that will be developed under the guidance of commissioners. Get involved The NHS CBA and Monitor are at the NHS Confederation annual conference and exhibition on stands D32 and C12 respectively. Keith Holden from the NHS CBA and Amy Cauldwell-Nichols from Monitor will be holding an eXhibition eXchange session on the Framework and answering questions at the NHS CBA stand (D32) on Thursday 21 June 2012 between 1.10pm and 2.10pm .

      "title": "[DUP] Briefing note on CCG indicative running cost allowances | NHS England",
      "content": "The NHS Commissioning Board Authority has today published a briefing note on the indicative running costs allowances for 212 proposed CCGs for 2013-14. The running costs allowance for CCGs has already been set at up to \u00a325 per head of population per year. This limit meets the requirement to reduce system wide administration costs by one third, and ensures spending on running costs is kept to a reasonable level and NHS funding is focused on providing high quality services for patients and the public. The Board Authority has decided that the fairest approach to calculating running costs allowances for CCGs is to base them on the GP registered lists for practices within the CCG but moderated at local authority level to match the Office for National Statistics\u2019 (ONS) population projections. This ensures that the aggregate population figures match the ONS estimate of the England population, and helps take account of the unregistered population.

      "content": "[NEEDS_PARAPHRASE] Preparations for the new commissioning world continue at a great pace and life seems no less hectic. Much of my time over the past few weeks has been taken up interviewing for Commissioning Support Service Managing Directors. The successful appointees were announced last week, and we are now into a second recruitment round, which will give senior NHS managers in SHAs and PCTs another chance to apply, but will also be wider, and including \u2018headhunting\u2019 managers from the NHS provider sector. It is my view that the best candidates will have \u201cgravitas and humility\u201d. I truly believe that the best people for most of these jobs are senior NHS managers who can demonstrate commercial acumen and an innovative approach. We have also decided to confirm that the 23 CSSs agreed at checkpoint 2 will proceed through 2013/14. All 23 are undoubtedly viable and CCGs need certainty about contracts. The precise size and management arrangements of the 23 will be determined as we move through the next few months and service level agreements with CCGs are signed. We are also, of course, currently focusing on Wave 1 authorisation and I am very pleased to say that we have received applications and supporting evidence from all 35 of the CCGs who agreed to submit. Additionally, we have now published a draft guide for assessors undertaking the desk top review of CCG applications. This guidance is intended to accompany Clinical commissioning group authorisation: Guide for applicants and should be used in conjunction with that document. Meanwhile, our work on the underpinning themes and rules is still as busy. The Health and Social Care Act 2012 sets out the high-level framework for the establishment of CCGs and provides for regulations to set out more specific provisions. The NHS (Clinical Commissioning Groups) Regulations 2012 were laid in Parliament on 26 June and make provision for the membership, names, establishment and governance of CCGs. A draft code of conduct has also been published which sets out additional safeguards that CCGs are advised to use when commissioning services for which GP practices could be potential providers. This is intended to both support CCGs in further developing their governance arrangements and to allow wider engagement on the proposals, which the NHS CB can then take into account when publishing statutory guidance later in the year. I am sure it is no less busy on the front line as practices and CCGs prepare for the future. As I go round the country, I am amazed at the progress everyone is making and the real improvements being made in patient care. Week by week we are moving ever closer to the new system going live on 1 April 2013 \u2013 an exciting prospect, but salutary I think! Comments on this page are now closed. Share: Tweet",

      "content": "Using Facebook ads to increase referrals to psychological therapies in Essex James Sharp, Digital Media and Marketing Manager at Mid Essex Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), talks about how using Facebook ads have helped to increase referrals to psychological therapies. Page contents In February 2018, our transformation team \u2013 the commissioning engine at the heart of the organisation - recognised that referrals into its Health in Mind service (part of the national initiative Improving Access to Psychological Therapies) \u2013 were under-target. Data indicated that the Health in Mind service was well-regarded but public awareness and accessibility was low. Despite ongoing marketing and promotion by the provider \u2013 CCG commissioners were unhappy that this great service was not being fully-utilised. The transformation team turned to communications and marketing colleagues for help. After several brainstorm sessions and background research across the NHS for best practice, we decided to trial a digital-led solution in a bid to increase referrals. Facebook Advertising - in a nutshell Advertising on Facebook makes it easy to find the right people, capture their attention and get results. You can choose your audience based on demographics, behaviours, contact information or specific keywords. Your adverts are then shown to your target audience in a range of areas on Facebook such as the sidebar. Based on the audience or keyword you select, you pay a certain amount for each time your ad is clicked. The Cost-Per-Click, or CPC, is determined by how many people on Facebook you can reach, and how competitive that audience is. Piloting a new approach Targeted Facebook advertising is a tested approach amongst many accomplished marketeers but is underutilised in the world of NHS digital communications. Working with the CCG\u2019s lead commissioner for mental health, we carefully crafted a series of targeted messages to send to a select audience group during a four week trial period. The aim was to see if using the paid-for advertising arm of Facebook could directly increase the rate of referrals in those selected audience groups. \u201cOverall, referrals to Health in Mind increased by 36% over the trial period with a marked improvement in male referrals.\u201d Driving uptake of services Over the course of the four-week trial, this digital marketing approach managed to increase traffic by almost 74% to the CCG website page on Health in Mind. A total of 341 visits to the page came directly from Facebook compared to just 24 visits the month before the campaign. Overall, referrals to Health in Mind increased by 36% over the trial period with a marked improvement in male referrals - one of the specific targeted audiences identified) \u2013 especially after some specific messaging during men\u2019s mental health awareness week and the national launch of the CALM initiative (Campaign Against Living Miserably) \u2013 an awareness campaign aimed at supporting men with mental health. The provider feedback demonstrated a week-on-week increase in referrals. Asking the audience One of the unique aspects of our digital approach was use of imagery. We set up a small virtual focus group of men aged between 25 and 45 to gain feedback on types of images to use and content of messaging. The feedback from the group was to steer away from the traditional photos used of people looking anxious or worried and focused instead on depicting a positive, everyday image to attract a wider cohort of the targeted audience. All advertising went out with the premise of by self-referring to Health in Mind, you can \u201cfind ways to get help you get back to the things you enjoy.\u201d Since the Health in Mind Facebook trial, the CCG\u2019s transformation team has championed digital advertising for two other services; given lessons-learned and practical mentoring to communications and commissioning colleagues in other Essex CCGs. I have shared lessons learned with the commissioned providers own marketing team and given 1-2-1 tuition in advertising approaches on Facebook and with other social media. We have used this approach for a different project to similar effect and results and we have now revised our Digital Strategy to incorporate this methodology into future project plans and communications approaches. Examples of this are \u2013 in July 2018, the CCG will be launching a web and app-based mental health platform \u2013 Silvercloud. The primary approach to marketing this in mid Essex will be via Facebook advertising. The social media advertising story Caroline Rassell, Accountable Officer NHS Mid Essex CCG says that Facebook advertising provides good results and explains that using it fits with the organisations innovative approach \u201cI was initially sceptical that social media advertising would work for the CCG, but as an organisation that recognises the need for continued improvement and innovation, coupled with a compelling case from our Digital Communications team we knew we had to give it a try. Social advertising allowed us to place adverts in front of people we wanted to target with good, demonstrable results. It has transformed the way we approach our communications and has given us a new way to engage local people.\u201d The digital tool featured in this case study is an example of a resource being used by UCLPartners and/or its partner organisations. Its usage does not indicate endorsement by NHS Digital.

Page contents Download a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the gender pay gap within NHS Digital since March 2017. Our data This data is based on the 2,833 staff employed by NHS Digital, taken from a snapshot date of 31 March 2017. Findings are generally based on the largest variations between groups and if the sample size was deemed large enough to allow for inclusion. The information is sourced from: the Electronic Staff Record (ESR) warehouse system, which holds our staff data NHS Jobs - a recruitment website we use for our vacancies our 2017 Employee Engagement Survey Between 1 April 2016 and 31 March 2017: 349 new appointments were made 8,680 job applications were received 298 staff left the business Choose a demographic group: Gender Gender pay Age Disability Sexual orientation Ethnicity Religion or belief Marriage and civil partnership Pregnancy and maternity Gender reassignment Gender The gender composition of the workforce is similar to last year and may reflect our high number of traditionally male roles, such as IT. The data also showed that: more women than men were employed at bands 4 to 6 - this pattern reverses from band 7 upwards men make up nearly three quarters of band 9 roles (74% to 26%), but more women than men were appointed to band 9 roles in 2016/17 57.9% of 2016/17 appointments were men and 42.1% women - this is similar to the proportion of applications made and in line with the current workforce more women were appointed at bands 4 to 6 and more than two thirds appointed to bands 7 to 8d were men there was nearly an equal gender split of those applying for posts in the NHS Digital Academy, which focuses on early careers 24% of women work part time, compared to 5% of men 53% of leavers were men and 47% women, which is similar to the workforce profile Find out more gender information. Gender pay Download a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the gender pay gap within NHS Digital since March 2017. Women's mean and median pay (hourly rate) is lower than males. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates that the gender pay gap (median earnings) is 18.1%. NHS Digital is currently below this at 14.1%. The quartile pay bands demonstrate how the male and female split changes the higher up the organisation employees progress. Women (44% of the current workforce) have the highest representation at quartile A (58%) and the lowest representation at quartile D (31%). We use the national Agenda for Change job evaluation scheme to evaluate all new posts. Find out what's included in this information. Age The majority of employees are aged between 35 and 54 years. This may reflect the high amount of senior roles and the time required to gain this experience. We also found that: the largest group of job applicants were in the age group 30 to 39 years (35.1%) the largest group appointed were aged 35 to 44 years (34.1%), closely followed by 25 to 34 years (29.9%) - these groups also had the highest level of turnover at 29% (25 to 34 years) and 27% (35 to 44 years) most roles advertised were band 5 and above and required degree level experience 70% of 16 to 25 year olds who responded to the staff survey and declared their age feel that NHS Digital as a whole is managed well, whereas 45% of 46 to 55 year olds disagree with this statement Find out more age information. Disability The percentage of employees whose disability status was not disclosed or unknown has fallen from just over 55% to 24%, reflecting NHS Digital's efforts to improve the quality of data held. The report also showed that: 4.8% of job applicants and 4.2% of appointed employees declared a disability - this figure is similar to the overall workforce profile 93.2% of job applicants did not have a declared disability, which reduced to 73.1% at the appointment stage - 1.9% of job applicants chose not to disclose their disability status 8% of total leavers declared a disability - this is above the current workforce profile (5%) scores against each question in the staff survey were generally lower for those with a stated disability An external review of the Disability Confident scheme has taken place and was re-accredited last year. Find out more disability information. Sexual orientation Our data shows that: 23% of the workforce chose not to disclose their sexual orientation and 3% were unknown - this decreased from nearly 50% last year 3.3% of job applications were from LGB candidates, and 2.8% of appointments were LGB - this is similar to the current workforce 88.2% of job applicants were heterosexual, and this reduced to 72.3% at the appointment stage 2% of leavers identified as LGB, which is in line with the workforce Find out more sexual orientation information. Ethnicity BAME - Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic. Our job applications are anonymised and shortlisted based on knowledge, skills and experience to eliminate opportunities for unconscious bias. Our data showed that: 9% of employees did not state their ethnic origin. This is a reduction from 2015/16, when it was 17% 38.5% of job applications were from BAME candidates, and 12.7% of appointments were BAME 56.7% of applications and 71.5% of appointments were White in general, employees that declared their ethnicity as Asian or Asian British responded more positively than other groups within the staff survey (this is based on low numbers) employees that declared their ethnicity as Asian or Asian British were more positive than other groups in the employee survey in regards to having a voice (this is based on low numbers) 10% of leavers were BAME, which is below the BAME workforce (13%) Find out more ethnicity information. Religion or belief The largest religious belief is Christianity at 36% and 20% of staff were Atheist. We also found that: 28% of employees did not wish to disclose their religious belief and 3% of employees had an unknown religious belief, compared to over 50% for these groups last year of 361 appointed staff in 2016/2017, 30.2% had a religious belief of Christianity, 3.9% of Islam and 26.3% were Atheist 28.3% of appointed staff chose not to disclose their religious belief - 3% of appointed staff had an unknown religious belief 40.1% of job applicants had a religious belief of Christianity, 12.4% of Islam and 16.7% were Atheist - 13.3% of job applicants had an undisclosed religious belief 26% of leavers had a religious belief of Christianity and 10% were Atheist 23% of leavers chose not to disclose their religious belief and 33% of leavers had an unknown religious belief Marriage and civil partnership Our data for marriage and civil partnerships shows that: 1,304 (46%) of employees were married, 18 (1%) in a civil partnership and 813 (29%) single 7% of employees have chosen not to provide a specific marital status, whilst the marital status of 11% of employees is undefined 44.3% of job applicants were single and 44.1% were married 46.3% of appointed staff were married and 42.7% were single Our policies seek to ensure that employees are not discriminated against on the grounds of being married or in a civil partnership. Pregnancy or maternity NHS Digital's maternity leave policy ensures a focus on an individual's needs during pregnancy and maternity periods. Other support options include: flexible working special leave parental leave shared parental leave time off for antenatal classes Gender reassignment Data on gender reassignment is not currently recorded on ESR. NHS England are currently leading a piece of work to develop consistent national data standards relating to all aspects of the protected characteristics for the NHS, including gender reassignment.

      "title": "[DUP] Registering a birth - NHS Digital",
      "content": "Birth Notification Application guide for maternity Registering a birth Skip to content Page contents Summary This is part 4 of the Birth Notification Application (BNA) guide for maternity. Registering a birth is predominantly performed by the Maternity Units, and the following diagram summarises the main steps: Allocation of the mother\u2019s NHS Number is only carried out when all possible routes to find the mother\u2019s NHS Number or find her record on the PDS have failed. Most mothers will have a record on the PDS and an associated NHS Number. If the mother is registered with a GP they will already have an NHS Number and an allocation should not be performed. Instead further efforts should be made to find the mother\u2019s PDS record. Section 6 'Searching and allocation advice' contains detailed searching and allocation guidance. Finding the mother\u2019s record The initial step in the birth notification process is always to trace for the mother. It's important that all efforts are made to find the mother\u2019s PDS record - this will ensure that all the correct details are used and will avoid duplicate records being created. You should take care to ensure that the record selected is for the correct mother. This will avoid the mother\u2019s record becoming confused with another and prevent the baby's details from being linked to the wrong mother. The 'Find a patient' screen After accessing the SCRa you will be presented with the 'Find a patient' screen which allows you to find a mother\u2019s PDS record. Tracing methods Finding or tracing for a patient on the PDS using an NHS Number is always the best method of finding a unique match to an existing PDS record. Mothers who have been referred from primary care should always be referred for maternity care with their NHS Number. However, an NHS Number may not always be available or known. In these cases other available details, such as name, gender, date of birth and address should be used. The Searching Tips section has further guidance. If a single PDS record is found for the details entered, then the mother\u2019s demographic details are displayed. If multiple PDS records match the search criteria entered then they will be displayed in a Patient List. From the list you can carefully select the correct mother\u2019s PDS record to be used in the birth notification. If you're unable to find the mother\u2019s PDS record then alternative searches should be attempted. The Searching Tips section has further guidance. If you can't find a PDS record for the mother, and you're confident that you've attempted all possible means to find a record, then you can select the Allocate option. This will create a new PDS record for the mother and allocate an NHS Number for them (see ' Allocating an NHS Number for the Mother '). It's also possible to progress to the Birth Notification screen with no mother\u2019s PDS record found and no known NHS Number for the mother - this should only be performed when no record exists and it is not possible to allocate an NHS Number for the mother. Continue to the birth notification Confirm mother\u2019s PDS record When you have confirmed the correct mother\u2019s PDS record the demographic details are displayed for the mother. You can now select the Birth Notification tab to enter the birth notification details. Please note that you will not be able to continue to enter a birth notification if the selected PDS record is: not female female and under the age of 10 years No confirmed mother\u2019s PDS record If you have attempted all possible searches for the mother\u2019s record, but found no matching record, and cannot allocate an NHS Number for the mother, then you should not select any of the returned rows (if any exist). You should instead select the 'Proceed to Birth Notification without Mother\u2019s NHS Number' option by selecting the \u2018Birth Notification\u2019 link. This will allow you to complete the birth notification without a mother\u2019s NHS Number. You can allocate an NHS Number to the mother if you have attempted all possible searches for their record, but no matching record has been found. You should select the Allocate option and proceed to allocate a new NHS Number for the mother. These allocated details will be passed to the 'Enter Birth Notification' screen. Mother\u2019s PDS record is incorrect If you've attempted all possible traces for the mother, and you find a match to a PDS record that is not up-to-date (for example the address details are incorrect or the surname has changed), you should: confirm the patient using the old details, correct the details using the SCRa select the \u2018Birth Notification\u2019 and enter the birth notification details. Partial record returned for a mother If when searching for the mother\u2019s PDS record you discover that only a partial record is returned containing no address details, it means mother\u2019s location details are being protected. The following procedure should be taken: Continue to the Birth Notification tab and enter details of the birth. Request the patient\u2019s address; The address can be verified on entry You can reassure the mother that the details are not stored on the PDS and their PDS record status will not be amended. If the Mother doesn't wish to give their address then enter the address of the maternity ward as the Usual Address and follow local (manual) procedures to inform the child health unit of the mother\u2019s correct address from this point. Complete the Birth Notification. Allocating an NHS Number for the mother If you have attempted to search for the mother\u2019s PDS record and are confident that the record does not exist, then you may allocate an NHS Number for the mother. Remember, you must have tried all possible means of searching to find the mother\u2019s PDS record, and must be confident that no PDS record exists, before performing an allocation for the mother. You should follow these guidance principles before considering to add a new patient record to the PDS: Most patients will already have a record on the PDS and an NHS Number. Referrals from GPs should have the patient's NHS Number. Most duplicates are created because the patient has not been identified correctly and therefore not traced on the PDS. If there is any doubt about the patient\u201fs identity don't allocate. Limit the ability to allocate to a very small number of highly trained staff. Failure to follow these principles will result in the creation of duplicate records on the PDS. This means: significant additional work is needed both nationally by the National Back Office and locally, by all organisations that have had contact with the patient, to resolve the duplication a clinical is created risk for the patient - the existence of more than one PDS record means that organisations providing care may not identify the correct health record The PDS record that is created is not a full PDS record. It contains only the minimal data required to create both a record on the PDS and the birth notification for the baby. The Allocate screen If you want to allocate an NHS Number for a mother then you'll need to enter the mother's: surname forename date of birth address - the house name/flat number or house number/street must be entered, plus the postal town other names (optional) telephone number (optional) When you have entered the details you select to allocate the NHS Number for the mother, and the NHS Number is returned. Then, control will be passed automatically to the Enter Birth Notification screen. Defaulted data The GP practice code will be defaulted to \u2018V81997\u2019 (Not Registered). Note that the allocation will not perform the registration at a GP practice. If the mother has a GP then they will already have an NHS Number and you should not perform an allocation. Instead further efforts should be made to find the mother\u2019s PDS record. Previous NHS contact If the person has had previous NHS contact then they may have an NHS Number. If the patient has had previous contact select \u2018Yes\u2019. Entering a birth notification This screen is used to enter all of the details for the birth notification. It contains details for the mother, the baby, the birth, the place of birth and the notifying person. Control will be passed here after you have either: selected a mother\u2019s PDS record allocated an NHS Number for the mother\u2019s PDS record ensured that an NHS Number is not required for the mother and continued to the birth notification The Birth Notification screen All of the existing birth notification details used in the NHS Number for Babies (NN4B)/Care Identity Service (CIS) system or on Interim NHS Numbering System (INNS) are included here. There are no new details. All of the details are to be entered on one screen. Some details will be carried forward from the mother\u2019s PDS record. Additional details will be taken from your smartcard in order to minimise the amount of information that you need to enter. Initial display from Find a Patient or Allocate screens The table below shows the details that are pre-populated upon entry into this screen. Field name Source May be amended? Mother's details Entered in the Trace or Allocate screen No, they are shown on the banner at the top of the screen Notifying Person Surname Taken from your smartcard Yes Notifying Person Forename Taken from your smartcard Yes Notifying Organisation Code Taken from your smartcard Yes Notifying Organisation Name Derived from values on your smartcard No 1 Baby\u2019s Surname Defaulted to the Mother\u2019s Surname Yes Baby\u2019s Usual Address Defaulted to the Mother\u2019s Usual Address Yes All other details are blank.

This option is only available if you are entering a multiple birth (that is - that the Number of Births in Confinement is greater than one). 1 If you amend the Notifying Organisation Code then this value will be derived from the newly entered value. 2 If you amend the Partner Organisation Code then this value will be derived from the newly entered value. 3 If you amend the Responsible Organisation Code then this value will be derived from the newly entered value. 4 If you amend the Notifying Organisation Code then this value will be derived from the newly entered value. Duplicate checking After submitting a birth notification the details are validated. Any errors or omissions will be highlighted. If there are no errors then a birth notification will be submitted to the PDS where a number of checks are performed to ensure that it is not a duplicate. If the submitted details are similar to an existing birth notification this is classified as a \u2018potential duplicate\u2019. A list of these potential matches are displayed to you. You should browse the list of potential matches and confirm that the details you have submitted are unique. If this is the case then re-submit the Birth Notification. The birth notification will be sent to the PDS without further duplicate checks. If the submitted details are an exact duplicate of an existing birth notification an error message displayed. It is not possible to re-submit an exact match. Response following the submission of a birth notification After submitting a birth notification a Response screen will be displayed that shows all of the information included in the birth notification and the outcome of the submission. Failed submission If an error occurs after submitting a birth notification an error banner will be displayed across the top of the screen indicating why the submission has failed. The birth notification will be saved to allow you to meet any local business procedures that need to be carried out. The failed submission can be managed in the list birth notifications screen. Successful submission After successfully allocating an NHS Number for the birth notification, a response screen is displayed. This displays the baby\u2019s NHS Number and all of the details that have been entered. A number of options are available following a successful birth notification. These options are: Printing the birth notification This option allows you to print the birth notification as part of a discharge notice, or as a means to pass information to child health units in the event of an error or a failure in obtaining an NHS Number for the baby. These birth notifications can also be used as part of the local process for dual-keying if they are required. Printing the blood spot labels The blood spot labels must be attached to the newborn blood spot card. This includes all of the information required when processing the test. The labels can also be used on other physical media, such as printed medical records. There are two types of label; with and without barcoded NHS Numbers for the baby. Printing identity wristbands You can print out two identity bracelets for the baby if you have a thermal transfer printer 5 . These bracelets must fastened to the ankle and wrist of the baby to ensure identification. Entering another birth notification There are two options here; to enter another birth: for the same mother (if the Number of Births in Confinement is greater than 1, such as a multiple birth) for a different mother 5 The BNA has been written and tested using the Zebra HC100 and the Zebra GK420t thermal transfer printers.

      "content": "[NEEDS_PARAPHRASE] Freedom of information request NIC-440206-R0L0Q Freedom of information request for information contained within the IAPT dataset in relation to the use of IAPT services. Our response Thank you for your email dated 02 March 2021 requesting the following information: \u201cI would like to make an FOI request for the following for IAPT data: What is the national rate (% and mean n) of single sessions reported by IAPT services? (i.e. those who attend 1 session and then are discharged) What is the treatment conversion rate for IAPT services including single sessions? (IAPT definition of treatment (more than 2 sessions) divided by referral rate \u2013 if you work this out differently, what is the calculation for conversion rates?). (% and mean n) What is the treatment conversion rate for IAPT services excluding single sessions? (% and mean n) What is the treatment completion rate for IAPT services? (percentage of discharges from those accepted into treatment) (% and mean n) What is the national rate for treatment discharges for those who have been accepted for treatment and what is the discharge rate when looking it at all referrals (clock starts) to discharge? (% and mean n) What is the proportion of single sessions that make up the prevalence / access figure (i.e. % of access KPI made up from single sessions) Can these be broken down into National rates and rates for Greater Manchester CCGs?\u201d We have considered your request and in accordance with S.1 (1) of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA) I can confirm that we do hold part of the information that you have requested. The IAPT dataset changed from v1.5 (up to September 2020) to v2.0 (from Sept 2020 onwards). There will be some differences in the way activity is recorded between the different versions. Improving access to psychological therapies data set reports What is the national rate (% and mean n) of single sessions reported by IAPT services? (i.e. those who attend 1 session and then are discharged) The number of people attending a single session is published in the monthly reports as \u2018Count_EndedTreatedOnce\u2019 in v2.0 or \u2018EndedTreatedOnce\u2019 in v1.5. This data is available Monthly, for the following geographic breakdowns: England, Provider, CCG and CCG/Provider levels Both v1.5 and v2.0 have extensive breakdowns of how treatment was ended. This data is published in the monthly activity file. The table below provides examples of these breakdowns. Each measure in v1.5 has a column with the appropriate heading and in v2.0 the breakdowns are listed in the \u2018 measure_name \u2019 column. v1.5 MEASURE_NAME v2.0 MEASURE_NAME EndedBeforeAssessment Count_EndedBeforeAssessment EndedDeclined Count_EndedDeclined EndedDeceasedAssessedOnly Count_EndedDeceasedAssessedOnly EndedCompleted Count_EndedCompleted EndedDeceasedTreated Count_EndedDeceasedTreated AptAttended Count_ApptsAttended AptAttendedLate Count_ApptsAttendedLate EndedBeforeTreatment Count_EndedBeforeTreatment Count_EndedIncompleteAssessment Count_EndedBeforePatientRequested Count_EndedBeforeCareProfessionalPlanned Annual data is not available for these measures. What is the treatment conversion rate for IAPT services including single sessions? (IAPT definition of treatment (more than 2 sessions) divided by referral rate \u2013 if you work this out differently, what is the calculation for conversion rates?). (% and mean n) A referral is classed as completing a course of treatment when they have had 2 treatment sessions. As such we do not calculate figures based on single treatment appointments but the component parts such as ended treated once and number of referrals is available in the monthly publications. If this is not the information you require, please could you clarify what is meant by \u2018 conversion rate\u2019 ? (E.g. number of referrals that are completing treatment or number of referrals etc). What is the treatment conversion rate for IAPT services excluding single sessions? (% and mean n) Data for \u2018 finished course treatment \u2019 and \u2018 count of referrals \u2019 are available in the published data. It is however worth bearing in mind that these two measures are not based on the same group of referrals. Number of referrals is the number of referrals in the reporting period (i.e. month) whereas finished a course of treatment is the number of referrals where the referral ended in the reporting period (i.e. month), therefore these referrals will not necessarily have started in that reporting period. If this is not the information you require, please could you provide clarification on the term \u2018 conversion rate \u2019 as stated above for us to investigate further. What is the treatment completion rate for IAPT services? (percentage of discharges from those accepted into treatment) (% and mean n) We currently publish this figure each month in the \u2018Activity\u2019 section of the IAPT monthly publication page. It is calculated as follows: Number of referrals completing a course of treatment / Number of ended referrals. What is the national rate for treatment discharges for those who have been accepted for treatment and what is the discharge rate when looking it at all referrals (clock starts) to discharge? (% and mean n) Please see monthly and annual reports for available figures. If the information contained within these reports is not what you are requiring, please could you provide further clarification so that we can investigate further. What is the proportion of single sessions that make up the prevalence/access figure (i.e. % of access KPI made up from single sessions) NHS Digital do not publish access rates. Access rates are determined by dividing the number of referrals to IAPT services in a given period (the numerator for the calculation) by the number of people suffering from IAPT - relevant disorders in the wider population (also known as prevalence \u2013 this is the denominator for the calculation). The numerator for this rate is the number of referrals entering treatment, which is published in the Monthly and Quarterly Activity Data File CSVs as column \u2018Count_FirstTreatment \u2019. The denominator is an estimate based on the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey, Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing, England, 2014 . This information is not held at the relevant geographies by NHS Digital and so is not included in our publications. The relevant data can be requested from NHS England.

      "title": "[DUP] Historic PDF conversion: Disproportionate burden assessment - NHS Digital",
      "content": "Historic PDF conversion: Disproportionate burden assessment Our site contains a large number of PDFs created in previous years, especially in our data and information publications. Where these are no longer being updated, we do not intend to recreate them in accessible versions as this would be a disproportionate burden. The accessibility regulations don\u2019t require us to fix PDFs or other documents published before 23 September 2018 if they\u2019re not essential to providing our services. Page contents Scope This assessment relates to PDF documents no longer in active use only. We are fully committed to making all active documentation fully accessible, as HTML web pages, and hope to have completed this process by the end of 2020. We have prioritised the documents which get the highest use, and the vast majority of information on our site is fully accessible already. Benefits The benefits of making these PDFs into accessible HTML formats would be: Historical materials would be fully accessible to all users Historical materials would be more easily searchable and indexable Burden Our assessment of the burden of making these PDFs into accessible HTML formats is that: there are thousands of historic documents created by the organisation each document would require a number of hours of work to be recreated in a fully accessible version (estimated based on extensive experience of converting the active documents at between 2 and 30 hours per document, depending on length and complexity, plus any required sign-off) many of the documents are officially published (e.g. Official or National Statistics) and publishing a new version requires detailed checking, a formal sign-off process, and submitting a new official version to the national statistician many of the documents contain complex elements which are difficult to retrospectively convert, such as detailed tables, graphs, and diagrams Other factors Also relevant to this decision are that: Interest in these documents is low \u2013 few people access them The documents do meet accessibility requirements for a large number of users, although some groups will find them disproportionately difficult Of the documents we are proposing would represent a disproportionate burden, requests for additionally accessible versions are rare We have and will always assist with accessible versions on request Assessment Where documents are no longer in active use, or no longer being updated, there is a high cost in terms of employee hours to convert. These documents are part of the public record, but no longer represent the current position, and interest is limited. We always respond to requests for our publications in different formats on a case-by-case basis, so accessible versions are available on demand, with a short lead-time. We consider that the costs of converting older documents where there is little evidence of demand would be a poor use of limited staff time, and would represent a disproportionate burden on the organisation in terms of cost.

SCRIPT is an e-learning platform for junior doctors that helps them to prescribe medicines more safely and effectively. The initiative picked up the award for \u2018Improving Safety in Medicines Management\u2019 at the recent Patient Safety Awards. It is a 40-module programme that tests students as they complete each block of modules to measure their improvement. The idea came from Professor Liz Hughes, Director of Education and Quality at Health Education West Midlands and the West Midlands Postgraduate Dean, following studies indicating that some newly-qualified doctors needed further preparation for prescribing. SCRIPT involved specialists and academics from Health Education West Midlands, Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust, the University of Birmingham, Aston University and the University of Warwick. The project team includes academics and clinical pharmacists and pharmacologists from local hospital trusts. Professor Hughes said: \u201cThe development of SCRIPT represents a significant contribution to patient safety by improving prescribing knowledge for both medical and non-medical prescribers alike. She said: \u201cWe were delighted to win the award. We have had excellent feedback from junior doctors who have used SCRIPT and we are very pleased that other regions are now adopting it themselves. We knew that it was a very important initiative that would help junior doctors to deliver safer, better care to patients but it was good to get national recognition for the work.\u201d For further information contact Sukvinder Kaur, Senior Project Manager, sukvinder.kaur@wm.hee.nhs.uk - END - Notes for editors: HEE was established on 28 June 2012, working as a shadow Special Health Authority from 1 October 2012.

This is to ensure students have access to specialty-specific e-learning courses which are directly mapped to their curriculum and learning needs, improving education and better preparing them to deliver high quality care to their future patients. e-Learning for Healthcare works with NHS and professional bodies to devise and deliver nationally validated e-learning to support statutory, mandatory and professional education and training to health and social care across the UK. This access will ensure that every midwife, radiographer and health visitor student is using training packages that are appropriate and necessary in preparing them for their future role in the NHS. Director of National Programmes for HEE, Patrick Mitchell, said: \u201cCurrently our e-Learning for Healthcare Service can only be accessed for free by those working in the NHS. By widening access to include midwives, radiographers and health visitors in higher education, we are ensuring students and their tutors can access high-quality education packages appropriate to their area of study, so that they are better prepared for when they enter the workforce. \u201cWe have given these three groups free access because they require access to specific e-learning courses we\u2019ve created. These courses map directly to their curriculum, namely fetal monitoring for midwifery, image interpretation for radiography, and the healthy child programme for health visiting.\u201d e-Learning for Healthcare provides free e-learning packages to NHS Trusts.

      "content": "[NEEDS_PARAPHRASE] 8 August 2013 - 12:52 A message from Chris Welsh, Director of Education and Quality for HEE. It gives me great pleasure to welcome our new generation of doctors as you embark on careers that will be fulfilling and rewarding for you and also help to deliver safe, high quality care for the patients we serve. Health Education England (HEE) exists for one purpose only \u2013 to help deliver the highest quality public health and healthcare possible to the population of England. We are the new body responsible for the education and training of the entire workforce, across the 350 careers that are delivering health services. As Director of Education and Quality at HEE, and as a former NHS surgeon, I believe that by investing in people and delivering high quality education and training, we will deliver improved patient care. It\u2019s my job to make sure this happens, and I believe it starts with our students. You, as junior doctors and medical students, and the 160,000 others who are on NHS courses every day, have responsibility for delivering high quality of care to your patients. In HEE, we are responsible for the quality of your education and training now and in the future. We want to know that you\u2019re getting that. As a junior doctor, you will be enthusiastic and eager to make a difference to the lives of your patients. I was too. Some of you joining the service now will still be in the NHS in 2050. I don\u2019t know what healthcare will look like then, neither do you, but we should always be open to the new, ever prepared to learn, innovate and change. Only then can we ensure the best for our patients. If you have ideas that you think could improve patient care, we will support you to be innovative and bold so that you can make a difference. Equally, as the eyes and ears of health services, if you see something that is wrong, don\u2019t stand by and let it happen, but tell someone about it. We are investing just under half of our \u00a35bn budget funding doctor\u2019s university degrees and postgraduate placements. This huge investment is not just about providing you with the skills to care for patients, but instilling the core values from the NHS Constitution in our staff. Compassion, understanding, delivering high quality care and putting patients first are just a few of the attributes we expect you to bring into the NHS during your career. That\u2019s why, this year and next, every member of NHS staff will be recruited, not only on qualifications, knowledge and experience, but also on your values and behaviours. That can only be good for our patients and our NHS. I\u2019m enormously proud to be part of HEE and what it is trying to achieve \u2013 a health service with the right people with the right values, skills and behaviours and in the right numbers \u2013 and proud of my 30-year record of service as a surgeon. I hope that our investment in you, as the next generation of doctors helps you to fulfil your ambitions to deliver excellent care to patients now and in the future. Over the next few months, I am keen to get out and about where I can to meet and hear from you in your universities and NHS placements and I look forward to meeting some of you during the course of your studies.

      "title": "[DUP] HEE recommends authorisation of 13 Local Education and Training Boards | Health Education England",
      "content": "Health Education England (HEE) has recommended the establishment of 13 Local Education and Training Boards (LETBs), which will take on their functions from 1 April if approved. LETB boards, which will be committees of HEE, are made up of representatives from local providers of NHS services. Final decisions about the authorisation of LETBs will be taken at the HEE board meeting on 27 March. Each of the proposed 13 LETBs has a number of areas for development. Areas for development, or conditions, are not indicators of the ability of LETBs, which each have their own unique circumstances. Up until now, LETBs have been operating in shadow form with delegated authority from Strategic Health Authorities. Since November last year, they have been going through a rigorous authorisation process to test their abilities in six specific areas: vision and leadership; meaningful engagement with key partners; good governance; effective financial control; organisational capacity; and outcome-led improvements. At their meeting on 27 March, the HEE board will need to decide whether the LETBs have reached the standards required in each of these areas and are ready to lead local health care education and training. Board members will decide whether each LETB should be authorised, authorised with conditions, or not authorised. Recommendations and any relevant conditions will be available here http://hee.nhs.uk/category/heeboardpapers/ Dr Nicki Latham, HEE Chief Operating Officer, said: \u2018With employers and professionals as part of their governing bodies, LETBs will improve the quality of education and training outcomes to meet the needs of patients, the public and service providers in their areas. Dr Latham said: \u2018They will have the flexibility to invest in education and training to support innovation and development of the wider health system. They will also be able to ensure that money in the new system follows students and trainees on the basis of quality and education and training outcomes. LETBs will be key in ensuring that the system responds to the recommendations of the Francis report and help improve the quality of patient care at every turn.\u2019 From 1 April, HEE will have a dedicated education and training budget of around \u00a35 billion and the majority of this will be spent locally by LETBs. Dr Latham said: \u2018HEE exists for one reason and one reason only: to support the delivery of excellent healthcare and health improvement to the patients and the public of England, by ensuring that or workforce has the right numbers, skills, values and behaviours, at the right time and in the right place. HEE and its LETBs will be spending \u00a310,000 a minute to ensure high quality education and training that improves care for patients.\u2019 For further information contact Richard Green, Head of Media Relations, 0208 433 6845/07557 204428 Notes for editors: HEE was established on 28 June 2012 , working as a shadow Special Health Authority from 1 October 2012 .

      "content": "[NEEDS_PARAPHRASE] 15 August 2013 - 13:50 NHS Employers and Health Education England held two events which looked at successful values based recruitment strategies and methodologies in the NHS and the positive impact this has on patient care. We know that many employers have been working to embed the right values, attitudes and behaviours in their trusts for some time now, all driven by a desire to improve outcomes for patients\u2026.you\u2019ve also been telling us that to do values based recruitment properly and evaluate its impact is complex. We held two events entitled \u2018Values based recruitment: start as you mean to go on\u2019 in Leeds and London to find out how we can best support you to test and assess the values of potential recruits. Over 140 senior HR professionals from the NHS attended. The events were co-chaired by Dean Royles (Chief Executive) and Sue Covill (Director of Employment Services) from NHS Employers and Nicki Latham (Chief Operating Officer) from Health Education England. With the aim of showcasing some of the good work already happening across the NHS to recruit the right people into the service, delegates heard from four trusts about their values work: Bradford District Care Trust York Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, and Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust Each speaker explained why their trust had set out to embed values in their recruitment and other employment practices, the context they were working in, what they had done to implement values based recruitment, and the impact it had had to date. Discussions were held to establish how employers felt we could support you to embed values in your own employment practice. The ideas gathered will be used to inform proposals for how we continue to work with you on this important agenda.

      "title": "[DUP] Health Education England \u00bb HEE launches first national consultation on a NHS bands 1-4 workforce strategy",
      "content": "[NEEDS_PARAPHRASE] 4 February 2014 - 14:53 Health Education England (HEE) has launched a consultation to hear views about developing staff in roles banded 1-4. The staff in bands 1-4 make up around 40 per cent of the NHS\u2019s 1.3 million workforce, and are responsible for an estimated 60 per cent of direct patient contact. However, this group receives only around 5 per cent of the whole training budget. HEE wants to know what people think are the barriers and challenges for this part of the workforce, and how these can be overcome. All the feedback collected will be analysed to create a bands 1-4 national strategy \u2013 \u201cThe Talent for Care\u201d: The closing date for feedback is 24 March 2014. The project also wants to establish nationally agreed recognition of support roles in the healthcare team and their part in delivering high quality, safe patient care. It also will develop formal opportunities for people to improve and progress within and beyond bands 1-4, through nationally agreed arrangements, consistent standards and certification, where relevant. As such HEE is looking for ambition, innovation and the commitment to widen the bands 1-4 route to clinical and professional training; but most of all, to provide some of the best patient care in the world. The support in training and development of our Bands 1-4 Workforce has been identified as a core objective in the Health Education England Mandate (April 2013 to March 2015) and is also recognised as a key priority for HEE and its LETBs.
